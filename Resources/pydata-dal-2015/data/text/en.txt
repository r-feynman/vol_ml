Wikipedia ( i / ˌ w ɪ k ɨ ˈ p iː d i ə / or i / ˌ w ɪ k i ˈ p iː d i ə / WIK -i- PEE -dee-ə ) is a free-access , free content Internet encyclopedia , supported and hosted by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation . Anyone who can access the site [ 5 ] can edit almost any of its articles. Wikipedia is the sixth-most popular website [ 4 ] and constitutes the Internet's largest and most popular general reference work . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] However, critics have worried that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias , and that its group dynamics hinder its goals. Most academics , historians , teachers and journalists reject Wikipedia as a reliable source of information for being a mixture of truths, half truths, and some falsehoods, [ 9 ] and that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin. [ 10 ] Wikipedia's Consensus and Undue Weight policies have been repeatedly criticised by prominent scholarly sources for undermining freedom of thought and leading to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia on January 15, 2001. Sanger [ 15 ] coined its name , [ 16 ] a portmanteau of wiki (from the Hawaiian word for "quick" ) [ 17 ] and encyclo pedia . Although Wikipedia's content was initially only in English, it quickly became multilingual , through the launch of versions in different languages. All versions of Wikipedia are similar, but important differences exist in content and in editing practices. The English Wikipedia is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias, but remains the largest one, with over 4.6 million articles. As of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month. [ 18 ] Wikipedia has more than 22 million accounts, out of which there were over 73,000 active editors globally as of May 2014. [ 2 ]
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle--i.e. waiting for a problem to arise and then fixing it--regarding the security of its content; [ 19 ] it started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would immediately become available. As a result, all articles could contain inaccuracies, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text until an editor would correct these issues.
Over time, the English Wikipedia and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example, in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [ 20 ] On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now "protected" to some degree. [ 21 ] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected , meaning that only certain editors are able to modify it. [ 22 ] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes. [ 23 ]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles, [ 24 ] which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending changes" system in December 2012. [ 25 ] Under this system, new users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are "subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication". [ 26 ]
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The "History" page of each article links to each revision. [ notes 2 ] [ 27 ] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a "watchlist" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. "New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems. [ 28 ]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as easy access to past versions of a page favor "creative construction" over "creative destruction". [ 29 ]
Any edit that changes content in a way that deliberately compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of spam . [ 30 ] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively. [ 31 ]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wiki articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair. [ 34 ]
In the Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident , an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. [ 34 ] The article remained uncorrected for four months. [ 34 ] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University , called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research tool". [ 34 ] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people . [ 37 ]
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, the copyright laws) of the United States and of the U.S. state of Virginia , where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the "five pillars" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors work as a community to write and revise the website's policies and guidelines. [ 38 ] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [ 24 ]
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-like. [ 39 ] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability" , [ 40 ] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. [ 41 ] It must not present original research . A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source . Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations. [ 42 ] This can at times lead to the removal of information that is valid. [ 43 ] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. [ 44 ] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. [ 45 ] This is known as neutral point of view ( NPOV ).
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] A small number of administrators are allowed to modify any article, and an even smaller number of bureaucrats can name new administrators.
An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority. [ 48 ]
Avoidance of a Tragedy of the commons or Free rider problem in the Wiki-Commons [ clarification needed ] is attempted via community control mechanisms and trading status [ clarification needed ] and attention of individual Wikipedia authors. [ 49 ] Dan Bricklin said Wikipedia is a prominent example of the " cornucopia of the commons". [ 50 ]
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with " administrator ", [ 51 ] [ 52 ] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and try to prevent certain persons from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism). [ 53 ] [ 54 ]
Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous. [ 55 ]
Wikipedians may dispute, for example by repeatedly making opposite changes to an article. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Over time, Wikipedia has developed a number of processes which may settle disputes. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at the Village Pump , or initiate a request for comment .
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [ 59 ] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased ). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%) or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior . When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings. [ 60 ]
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated "Talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. [ 61 ]
Wikipedia's community has been described as cult -like, [ 62 ] although not always with entirely negative connotations. [ 63 ] The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials , has been referred to as " anti-elitism ". [ 64 ]
Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. [ 65 ]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. [ 66 ] As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project. [ 67 ] Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization". [ 68 ] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, 1 percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits." [ 69 ] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz , who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [ 70 ]
A report in August 2014 showed that Wikipedia had at least 80,000 editors. [ 71 ] A significant decline in the number of English-language editors was reported in 2013 by Tom Simonite who stated: "The number of active editors on the English-language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51,000 and has been declining ever since...(t)his past summer (2013) only 31,000 people could be considered active editors." [ 72 ] Several attempts to explain this have been offered. One possible explanation is that some users become turned off by their experiences. [ 73 ] Another explanation, according to Eric Goldman, is found in editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references". Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, [ 74 ] as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation", [ 75 ] but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia […] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site". [ 76 ] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that "(I)t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users... 524 people... And in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits." [ 68 ] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders". [ 68 ]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content". [ 79 ]
One study found that the contributor base to Wikipedia "was barely 13% women; the average age of a contributor was in the mid-20s". [ 80 ] A 2011 study by researchers from the University of Minnesota found that females comprised 16.1% of the 38,497 editors who started editing Wikipedia during 2009. [ 81 ] In a January 2011 New York Times article, Noam Cohen observed that just 13% of Wikipedia's contributors are female according to a 2009 Wikimedia Foundation survey. [ 82 ] Sue Gardner , a former executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, hopes to see female contributions increase to twenty-five percent by 2015. [ 83 ] Linda Basch, president of the National Council for Research on Women, noted the contrast in these Wikipedia editor statistics with the percentage of women currently completing bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD programs in the United States (all at rates of 50 percent or greater). [ 84 ]
In response, various universities have hosted edit-a-thons to encourage more women to participate in the Wikipedia community. In fall 2013, 15 colleges and universities, including Yale, Brown, and Pennsylvania State, offered college credit for students to "write feminist thinking" about technology into Wikipedia. [ 85 ]
In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales announced in a BBC interview the Wikimedia Foundation 's plans for "doubling down" on the issue of gender bias on Wikipedia . Wales agreed that Sue Gardner's goal of 25% women enrollment by 2015 had not been met. Wales said the foundation would be open to more outreach, more software changes, [ 86 ] and more women administrators. Software changes were left open to explore ways of increasing the appeal of Wikipedia to attract women readers to register as editors, and to increase the potential of existing editors to nominate more women administrators [ clarify ] to enhance the 'management' presence of women at Wikipedia. [ 87 ]
There are currently 287 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions , or simply Wikipedias ). Eleven of these have over one million articles each ( English , Dutch , German , French , Italian , Polish , Spanish , Russian , Swedish , Vietnamese , and Waray-Waray ), four more have over 700,000 articles ( Cebuano , Chinese , Japanese , Portuguese ), 37 more have over 100,000 articles, and 73 more have over 10,000 articles. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 4.6 million articles. As of June 2013 [update] , according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia ) receives approximately 56% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Spanish: 9%; Japanese: 8%; Russian: 6%; German: 5%; French: 4%; Italian: 3%). [ 90 ] As of November 2014, the six largest language editions are (in order of article count) the English , Swedish , Dutch , German , French , and Waray-Waray Wikipedias. [ 91 ]


Distribution of the 33,911,832 articles in different language editions (as of 21 November 2014) [ 92 ]
The unit for the numbers in bars is articles. Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition ). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color ) [ 94 ] or points of view. [ 95 ]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use . [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language". [ 99 ] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). [ 100 ] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, [ 101 ] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. [ 102 ] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed. [ 103 ] Articles available in more than one language may offer " interwiki links ", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.
A study published by PLOS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that almost 51% of edits from North America are limited to the English Wikipedia and this value decreases to 25% in simple English Wikipedia . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ not in citation given ] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to thirty-seven percent by 2015. [ 106 ]
On 1 March 2014, The Economist in an article titled "The Future of Wikipedia" cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia stating that: "The number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years." [ 107 ] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated. [ 107 ] Given that the trend analysis published in The Economist presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis. [ 107 ] No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English language Wikipedia. [ 108 ]
Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia , a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis , a web portal company. Its main figures were the Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger , editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman . [ 109 ] Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, [ 112 ] [ 113 ] Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. [ 114 ] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia. [ 115 ]
Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com, [ 116 ] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [ 112 ] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view" [ 117 ] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia. [ 112 ] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit. [ 118 ]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. On August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles. [ 119 ] On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 articles. [ 120 ] And by the end of 2001 it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions. It had reached 26 language editions by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004. [ 121 ] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing even the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia , which had held the record for 600 years. [ 122 ]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. [ 123 ] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org . [ 124 ]
Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [ 125 ] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [ 126 ] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. [ 127 ] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called "low-hanging fruit" – topics that clearly merit an article – have already been created and built up extensively. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid ( Spain ) found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. [ 133 ] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study. [ 134 ] Two years later, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. [ 135 ] In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable," a claim which was questioned by MIT's Technology Review in a 2013 article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia." [ 72 ] In July 2012, the Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline. [ 136 ] In the 25 November 2013 issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis. In 2013, MIT's Technology Review revealed that since 2007, the site has lost a third of the volunteer editors who update and correct the online encyclopedia's millions of pages and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae." [ 137 ]
In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the United States, according to comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing the New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors. [ 138 ] In February 2014, Wikipedia was the sixth-most popular website worldwide according to Alexa Internet , [ 90 ] receiving 12 billion pageviews every month [ 139 ] (2.7 billion from the United States [ 140 ] ). On 9 February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, "according to the ratings firm comScore." [ 18 ]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours . [ 141 ] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]
Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through " stigmergic accumulation". [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
On 20 January 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia growth flattened but that it has "lost nearly 10 per cent of its page-views last year. That's a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by 12 per cent, those of German version slid by 17 per cent and the Japanese version lost 9 per cent." [ 146 ] Varma added that, "While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users." [ 146 ] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for internet and Security indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further]." [ 146 ]

As Wikipedia has become a main source for a wide range of general knowledge, criticism sites have developed that were instrumental in exposing the dark side of Wikipedia such as paid advocacy. [ 147 ] As of 2014, the most prominent site is Wikipediocracy , which, according to Wikipedia, "has provided some journalists with background information on Wikipedia's controversies ." [ 148 ] Several Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation , which includes over 50 policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. [ 149 ] [ 150 ]
Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias , and that its group dynamics hinder its goals. Most academics , historians , teachers and journalists reject Wikipedia as a reliable source of information for being a mixture of truth, half truth, and some falsehoods. [ 9 ] Articles in the Times Higher Education magazine, The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Consensus and Undue Weight policies, concluding that the first undermines the Freedom of thought and the second; the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather only present the majority "weight" of viewpoints creates omissions which can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Novelist and critic A. S. Byatt has described this consensus populism as leading to the tyranny of the majority . [ 151 ] A New York Times article concluded that the casual reader is not aware of these policies which restrict freedom of expression. [ 152 ]
Prominent unorthodox scientists Brian Josephson , Jack Sarfatti and Rupert Sheldrake share the critical view that, "Wikipedia seemed to be in the hands of a group of sceptical minds, intent on making sure there were no mysteries and no conspiracies." [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Members of the alternative medicine community have accused Wikipedia of systematically and dogmatically being biased and misleading against alternative medicine. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black noted how articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an "ax to grind" on the topic. [ 9 ] [ 161 ] An article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin. [ 10 ]
Scholar and author Mark Bauerlein perceives Wikipedia as a threat for being a "monolith enclosing the knowledge worlds of students". [ 162 ] The Academic Integrity at MIT handbook for students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology states: 'Wikipedia is Not a Reliable Academic Source: The bibliography published at the end of the Wikipedia entry may point you to potential sources. However, do not assume that these sources are reliable – use the same criteria to judge them as you would any other source. Do not consider the Wikipedia bibliography as a replacement for your own research." [ 163 ]
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. Conversely, Wikipedia is often cited for factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations. However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three." [ 164 ] Reagle suggested that while the study reflects "a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects." [ 165 ] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica , [ 166 ] [ 167 ] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica . [ 168 ] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a "flawed study design" (in Nature '​s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals ), and a lack of study "statistical power" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 x 10 1 articles compared, vs >10 5 and >10 6 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [ 169 ]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [ 170 ] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, [ 171 ] the insertion of false information, [ 172 ] vandalism , and similar problems.
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [ 173 ]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. [ 174 ] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. [ 175 ] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia. [ 176 ]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls , spammers , and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. [ 27 ] [ 178 ] In response to paid advocacy and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article by Jeff Elder in The Wall Street Journal on 16 June 2014 to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. [ 179 ] The article stated that: "Beginning Monday (from date of article), changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'" [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report . [ 184 ]
On 5 March 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia", stated that "Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information." [ 185 ] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Dr. Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues , as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by Dr. James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of peer review evaluated articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer review evaluation standards. [ 185 ] In a 7 May 2014 follow-up article in The Atlantic titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text", Julie Beck quotes Wikiproject's Dr. James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference." [ 186 ] Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured.' Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than 1 percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed. [ 186 ]
Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work , preferring primary sources ; [ 187 ] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [ 188 ] [ 189 ] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citeable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [ 190 ] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said. [ 191 ]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University include Wikipedia in their syllabi , but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia. [ 192 ] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google , [ 193 ] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".
A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources". [ 194 ]
Because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig , a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its "clear and engaging prose", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing. [ 195 ] Most Wikipedia articles are related to history. [ 196 ] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online , he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised "McPherson's richer contextualization […] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice […] and […] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words." By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds "both verbose and dull". Rosenzweig also criticized the "waffling—encouraged by the npov policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history". By example, he quoted the conclusion of Wikipedia's article on William Clarke Quantrill . While generally praising the article, he pointed out its "waffling" conclusion: "Some historians […] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero." [ 195 ]
Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: "Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into to a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage." [ 197 ] A study of articles on cancer was undertaken in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University limited to those Wikipedia articles which could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluding Wikipedia articles written at the "start" class or the "stub" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that "Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing". [ 198 ] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: "inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information". [ 199 ]
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. [ 200 ] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism ). [ 201 ] [ 202 ] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic because Wikipedia is not censored . The policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China , [ 203 ] Pakistan , [ 204 ] and the United Kingdom , [ 205 ] among other countries.
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: [ 206 ]
These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its " Wikipedia Loves Libraries " program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [ 207 ]
A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science. [ 208 ]
Research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is most underrepresented. [ 209 ]
A "selection bias" may arise when more words per article are devoted to one public figure than a rival public figure. Editors may dispute suspected biases and discuss controversial articles, sometimes at great length.
When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, there may arise a systemic bias , such as non-opposite definitions for apparent antonyms. In 2011, Wales noted that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, which predominantly consists of young males with high education levels in the developed world ( cf previously). [ 135 ] The 22 October 2013 essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on recent downward trends in the number of editors available to support Wikipedia's range and coverage of topics. [ 72 ]
Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, for example favouring certain ethnicities or majority religions. [ 210 ] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture , inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. [ 210 ]
In the study of systemic bias in large institutions, patterns of maladaptive organizational behavior are identified which harm productivity and viability. Maladaptive organizational behavior patterns applying to Wikipedia include the following categories. [ 211 ] [ 212 ]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford , in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. [ 219 ] [ 220 ] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs." Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs." The results were tabulated for all language versions of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying to articles about (i) G.W. Bush , (ii) Anarchism and (iii) Mohammad . [ 220 ] By comparison, for German Wikipedia the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering (i) Croatia , (ii) Scientology and (iii) 9/11 Conspiracy Theories . [ 220 ]
—Larry Sanger, [ 221 ]
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting arguably objectionable content (such as Feces , Cadaver , Human penis , and Vulva ) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.
The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation , photographs of nude children , illustrations of zoophilia , and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles.
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer – a 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions – features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after it was reported by a member of the public as child pornography , [ 222 ] to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which issues a stop list to Internet service providers. IWF, a non-profit, non-government-affiliated organization, later criticized the inclusion of the picture as "distasteful". [ 223 ]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law . [ 224 ] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon , were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003 . [ 225 ] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law . [ 225 ] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. [ 226 ] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [ 227 ] saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it." [ 227 ] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted". [ 228 ] Critics, including Wikipediocracy , noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [ 229 ]
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a "private citizen" rather than a " public figure " in the eyes of the law. [ 230 ] [ notes 3 ] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life (" meatspace "). A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic , aka "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated. [ 231 ]
Wikipedia has a " Volunteer Response Team " that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. [ 232 ]
Attempts to delete an entry about the Wedding dress of Kate Middleton led to a controversy on the English Wikipedia. [ 233 ] Jimmy Wales used the example to illustrate his notion about a 'gender gap' in Wikipedia on the Wikimania 2012, [ 234 ] the issue received some press coverage. [ 235 ] [ 236 ]
One of the largest disputes in the German Wikipedia about a simple sentence was about the Donauturm in Vienna. [ 237 ] While the observation tower shares some architectural aspects with the Fernsehturm Stuttgart , it was never planned for TV broadcasting purposes. The German Wikipedia went through a rather lengthy (about 600 000 characters) discussion about the suitable title and category. Some (often Austrian) authors denied the description of Donauturm as a "TV tower", which was stubbornly defended by others. [ 237 ] The Spiegel coverage of the issue cited a participiant with "On good days, Wikipedia is better than any TV soap". [ 237 ]
Although poorly written articles are flagged for improvement, [ 238 ] critics note that the style and quality of individual articles may vary greatly.
In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism by Wikipedia editors on the English version. [ 239 ]
A group of Wikipedia editors may form a WikiProject to focus their work on a specific topic area, using its associated discussion page to coordinate changes across multiple articles. [ 240 ]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks . The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [ 241 ] Wikimedia chapters, local associations of users and supporters of the Wikimedia projects also participate in the promotion, development, and funding of the project. The foundation's recent 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million. [ 242 ]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its new executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [ 243 ] The Wall Street Journal reported on 1 May 2014 that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants to be free." [ 244 ] [ 245 ] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia who "said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities, Walsh said." [ 244 ]
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki , a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system. [ 246 ] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language , variables , a transclusion system for templates , and URL redirection . MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker .
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed [ 247 ] to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.
In April 2005, a Lucene extension [ 248 ] [ 249 ] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1, [ 250 ] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3. [ 251 ]
In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor , was opened to public use. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] [ 254 ] [ 255 ] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy". [ 256 ] The feature was turned off afterward.
Computer programs called bots have been used widely to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. [ 257 ] [ 258 ] [ 259 ] One controversial contributor massively creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to ten thousand articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [ 260 ] There are also some bots designed to automatically warn editors making common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parenthesis). [ 261 ] Edits misidentified by a bot as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot tries to detect and revert vandalism quickly and automatically. [ 258 ] Bots can also report edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as was done at the time of the MH17 jet downing incident in July 2014. [ 262 ] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved prior to activation. [ 263 ]
According to Andrew Lih , the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots. [ 264 ]
In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles. [ 265 ] The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either "A", " good article " or the highest, " featured article ". Of the total of about 4.4 million articles assessed as of 11 December 2013, approximately five thousand are featured articles (0.1%). One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia. [ 266 ] [ 267 ]
Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors. [ 268 ] A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles. [ 269 ]
The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a Wikiproject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "???" for unclassified/unsure level. For a particular article, different Wikiprojects may assign different importance levels.
The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia . If an article receives different ratings by two or more Wikiprojects, then the highest rating is used in the table. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day. [ 271 ] Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Squid caching servers. [ 272 ] Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. [ 273 ] Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu ). [ 274 ] [ 275 ] As of December 2009, there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam . [ 276 ] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia . [ 277 ] [ 278 ]
In accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, [ 279 ] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. [ 211 ] Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized "Thank" tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. [ 256 ] [ 280 ] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. [ 281 ] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually. [ 281 ]
According to the Michael Porter five forces analysis framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as "first movers" and "radical innovators" in the services provided and supported by an open-source, on-line encyclopedia. [ 282 ] The "five forces" are centered around the issue of "competitive rivalry" within the encyclopedia industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its "radical innovation" the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication. This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis. [ 283 ] The second force is the "threat of new entrants" with competitive services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a "first mover", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a fast second to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web. [ 284 ] Porter's third force is the "threat of substitute products" and it is too early to identify Google's "Knowledge Graphs" as an effective competitor given the current dependence of "Knowledge Graphs" upon Wikipedia's free access to its open-source services. [ 282 ] The fourth force in the Porter five forces analysis is the "bargaining power of consumers" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker of being "the encyclopedia which anyone can edit." [ 283 ] The fifth force in the Porter five forces analysis is defined as the "bargaining power of suppliers", presently seen as the open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia. [ 282 ]
Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia 's The Signpost , founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees. [ 285 ] It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects , such as Wikimedia Commons . Similar publications are the German-language Kurier , and the Portuguese-language Correro da Wikipédia . Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the "Wikiworld" web comic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors . There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education .
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. [ 286 ] GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under GPL . This made it a poor choice for a general reference work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [ 287 ] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [ 288 ] [ 289 ] [ 290 ] [ 291 ]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law ). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. [ 292 ]
The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. [ 293 ] [ 294 ]
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged. [ 305 ] Wikipedia publishes "dumps" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images. [ 306 ]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk , where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation , the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk , with an accuracy of 55%. [ 307 ]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection . Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on 9 February 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. [ 18 ] The The New York Times article reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more." [ 18 ] The New York Times reports that Mr. Moller of Wikimedia has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile," out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the on-line encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. [ 18 ]
Bloomberg BusinessWeek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in IOS with 15.2% of the market. [ 308 ] At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. [ 245 ] The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on 23 July 2014 to generally positive reviews scoring over 4 on a scale of 5 at a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [ 309 ] The latest version for IOS was released on 3 April 2013 to similar reviews. [ 310 ]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org , an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released, [ 311 ] located at en.m.wikipedia.org , which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone , Android -based devices or WebOS -based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata ), such as geoinformation . [ 312 ] [ 313 ]
Wikipedia Zero is an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries. [ 314 ]
Wikipedia is extremely popular. In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors." [ 18 ]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, [ 315 ] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. [ 316 ] About 50% of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, [ 317 ] a good portion of which is related to academic research. [ 318 ] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. [ 319 ] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [ 320 ] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements. [ 321 ]
According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47% of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [ 322 ]
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] The Parliament of Canada 's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act . [ 326 ] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization [ 327 ] – though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. [ 328 ] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports. [ 329 ] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. [ 330 ]
Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [ 331 ] [ 332 ] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia. [ 333 ] [ 334 ] [ 335 ]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube , Reddit , MySpace , and Facebook [ 336 ] ) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.
In July 2007 Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4 [ 337 ] which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ( Google , Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such 20th-century words as hoovering or Coca-Cola .
On September 28, 2007, Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama . He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [ 338 ]
On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign , saying: "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day." [ 339 ] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. [ 340 ]
Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience. [ 341 ]
Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004. [ 342 ] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category. [ 343 ] Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby award.
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15% of the votes in answer to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?" [ 344 ]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić , Eckart Höfling , and Peter Gabriel . The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger . [ 345 ]
Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality , meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on". [ 184 ] Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion ., [ 346 ] as well as the 2010 The Onion article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today". [ 347 ]
" My Number One Doctor ", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs , played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide . [ 348 ]
In 2008, the comedic website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [ 349 ]
The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia." [ 350 ]
In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia , which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [ 351 ]
In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0 , to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. [ 352 ] [ 353 ]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?" [ 354 ]
Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation . These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary , a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [ 355 ] Wikiquote , a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks , a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons , a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews , for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity , a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. [ 356 ] Of these, only Commons has had success comparable to that of Wikipedia. Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies , is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage , an editable travel guide, and Wikidata , an editable knowledge base, launched.
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopaedia Britannica , which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [ 357 ] [ 358 ] [ 359 ] Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, "The amorality of Web 2.0 ", that criticized websites with user-generated content , like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote: "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening." [ 360 ] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson , the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine , wrote in Nature that the " wisdom of crowds " approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals , with their rigorous peer review process. [ 361 ]
There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. "The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" Said Kathryn Hughes , professor of life writing at UEA and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian . [ 362 ]
In computational linguistics , information retrieval and natural language processing , Wikipedia has seen widespread use as a corpus for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification", [ 363 ] and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation . [ 364 ] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia. [ 365 ]
A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project , which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. [ 366 ]
One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2 , which was created by Douglas Adams . The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative. Everything2 was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges to public users.
GNE , an encyclopedia which was not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia early in its history; however, it has been retired. [ 109 ]
Other websites centered on collaborative knowledge base development have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu , Enciclopedia Libre , Hudong , and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review , such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium . The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia. [ 367 ] [ 368 ]

The United States of America ( USA or U.S.A. ), commonly referred to as the United States ( US or U.S. ), America , and sometimes the States , is a federal republic [ 17 ] [ 18 ] consisting of 50 states and a federal district . The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C. , are in central North America between Canada and Mexico . The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid- Pacific . The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean . At 3.80 million square miles (9.85 million km 2 ) [ 4 ] and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area and third-largest by population . It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries . [ 19 ] The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.
Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, [ 20 ] with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard . Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution . On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War , delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence . The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights , were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms .
Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny , the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. [ 23 ] This involved displacing native tribes , acquiring new territories , and gradually admitting new states . [ 23 ] The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country . [ 24 ] By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, [ 25 ] and its economy began to soar. [ 26 ] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower , the first country to develop nuclear weapons , the only country to use them in warfare , and as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower. [ 27 ]
The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy . [ 6 ] The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity. [ 28 ] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial , it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. [ 29 ] The country accounts for 37% of global military spending , [ 30 ] being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations. [ 31 ]


In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere "America" after the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci ( Latin : Americus Vespucius ). [ 32 ] The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq. , George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army . Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed , Moylan expressed his wish to carry the "full and ample powers of the United States of America" to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort. [ 33 ]
The first publicly published evidence of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymously written essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson included the phrase "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] In the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the pertinent section of the title was changed to read, "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America". [ 38 ] In 1777 the Articles of Confederation announced, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'". [ 39 ]
The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms include the "U.S.", the "U.S.A.", and "America". Colloquial names include the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". " Columbia ", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 1700s, [ 40 ] derives its origin from Christopher Columbus ; it appears in the name " District of Columbia ". In non-English languages, the name is frequently the translation of either the "United States" or "United States of America", and colloquially as "America". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used. [ 41 ]
The phrase "United States" was originally treated as plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., "the United States are"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as singular, a single unit—e.g., "the United States is"—after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States". [ 42 ] The difference has been described as more significant than one of usage, but reflecting the difference between a collection of states and a unit. [ 43 ]
The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an " American ". "United States", "American" and "U.S." are used to refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S. forces"). " American " is rarely used in English to refer to subjects not connected with the United States. [ 44 ]
The first North American settlers migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge approximately 15,000 or more years ago. [ 20 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture , developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. After European explorers and traders made the first contacts, the native population declined due to various reasons, including diseases such as smallpox and measles , [ 47 ] [ 48 ] intermarriage , [ 49 ] and violence . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]
In the early days of colonization many settlers were subject to shortages of food, disease and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. [ 53 ] At the same time however many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares. [ 54 ] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash in the frontier. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Indians and urged them to concentrate on farming and ranching without depending on hunting and gathering. [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
After Columbus ' first voyage to the New World in 1492 other explorers and settlement followed into the Floridas and the American Southwest. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] There were also some French attempts to colonize the east coast, and later more successful settlements along the Mississippi River . Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings. [ 59 ] Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom . The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, and the Mayflower Compact , signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies. [ 60 ] [ 61 ]
Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. [ 62 ] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west. [ 63 ] Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by the English, but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and better food and treatment, so the numbers of slaves grew rapidly. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions. [ 69 ]
With the colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established. [ 70 ] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. [ 71 ] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. [ 72 ] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.
In the French and Indian War , British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans , who were being conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. [ 73 ] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.
The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of "republicanism" that held government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen , “no taxation without representation”. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war. [ 74 ] Following the passage of the Lee Resolution , on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence , on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and finally declared, in the words of the resolution, that the 13 colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The latter date, July 4, 1776, is now celebrated annually as America's Independence Day . In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789. [ 75 ]
Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown . [ 76 ] In the peace treaty of 1783 , American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution , and it was ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington , who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights , forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. [ 77 ]
Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South , and along with it the slave population. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The Second Great Awakening , beginning about 1800, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism ; [ 81 ] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations. [ 82 ]
Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of Indian Wars . [ 83 ] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. [ 84 ] The War of 1812 , declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. [ 85 ] A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. [ 86 ] Expansion was aided by steam power , when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals , such as the Erie and the I&M ; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land. [ 87 ]
From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male suffrage, and it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest Destiny . [ 88 ] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest . [ 89 ] Victory in the Mexican-American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest. [ 90 ]
The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states. [ 91 ] After the American Civil War , new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans. [ 92 ] Over a half-century, the loss of the buffalo was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures. [ 93 ] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further warfare, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. [ 94 ]
From the beginning of the United States , inherent divisions over slavery between the North and the South in American society ultimately led to the American Civil War . [ 95 ] Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states , keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery. [ 96 ]
Following the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln , the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party , conventions in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America , while the U.S. federal government maintained secession was illegal. [ 96 ] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation , a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians. [ 97 ]
Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution prohibited slavery , made the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves [ 98 ] U.S. citizens , and promised them voting rights . The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power [ 99 ] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. [ 100 ] But following the Reconstruction Era , throughout the South Jim Crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Over the subsequent decades, in both the north and south blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination, including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence , sparking national movements against these abuses. [ 100 ]
In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. [ 101 ] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West . The later invention of electric lights and telephones would also impact communication and urban life. [ 102 ] The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. Mainland expansion was completed by the Alaska Purchase from Russia in 1867. In 1898 the U.S. entered the world stage with important sugar production and strategic facilities acquired in Hawaii . Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish American War .
Rapid economic development at the end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists, and the U.S. economy became the world's largest. Dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist , socialist , and anarchist movements. [ 103 ] This period eventually ended with the beginning of the Progressive Era , which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage , alcohol prohibition , regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.
The United States remained neutral at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, though by 1917, it joined the Allies , helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers . President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations . However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations. [ 104 ]
In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage . [ 105 ] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television . [ 106 ] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression . After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal , which included the establishment of the Social Security system. [ 107 ] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began around WWI and extended through the 1960s; [ 108 ] whereas, the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration. [ 109 ]
The United States was at first effectively neutral during World War II 's early stages but began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor , prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers . [ 110 ] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers, [ 111 ] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence. [ 112 ] Allied conferences at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system of international organizations that placed the United States and Soviet Union at the center of world affairs. As an Allied victory was won in Europe , a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter , which became active after the war. [ 113 ] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan ; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II. [ 114 ]
After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what is known as the Cold War , driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism . They dominated the military affairs of Europe , with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of " containment " toward Soviet bloc expansion. While they engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. The U.S. often opposed Third World left-wing movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought Communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a " Space Race " in which the United States became the first to land a man on the moon in 1969. [ 115 ] A proxy war was expanded in Southeast Asia with the Vietnam War . [ fn 1 ]
At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an interstate highway system transformed the nation’s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] A growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , sought to end racial discrimination. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war , black nationalism , and the sexual revolution . The launch of a " War on Poverty " expanded entitlement and welfare spending. [ 127 ]
The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation . After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms . Following the collapse of détente , he abandoned "containment" and initiated the more aggressive " rollback " strategy towards the USSR. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 a majority of women age 16 and over were employed. [ 133 ] The late 1980s brought a " thaw " in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ]
After the Cold War, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001. [ 138 ] Originating in U.S. defense networks , the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy, society, and culture. [ 139 ] On September 11, 2001 , Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. [ 140 ] In response the United States launched the War on Terror , which includes the ongoing war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War . [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Barack Obama , the first African-American , [ 143 ] and multiracial [ 144 ] president, was elected in 2008 amid the Great Recession . [ 145 ]
The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,941 km 2 ). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km 2 ). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific , southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km 2 ) in area. [ 146 ]
The United States is the world's third or fourth largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China . The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055 km 2 ) [ 147 ] to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091 km 2 ) [ 148 ] to 3,794,101 square miles (9,826,676 km 2 ). [ 149 ] to 3,805,927 square miles (9,857,306 km 2 ). [ 4 ] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada. [ 150 ]
The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont . The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest . The Mississippi – Missouri River , the world's fourth longest river system , runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.
The Rocky Mountains , at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado . Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave . The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast , both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the continental United States are in the state of California , and only about 80 miles (130 km) apart. At 20,320 feet (6,194 m), Alaska's Mount McKinley is the tallest peak in the country and in North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands , and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature. [ 151 ]
The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian , the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The southern tip of Florida is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains are alpine . The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California , and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes , and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in the Midwest's Tornado Alley . [ 152 ]
The U.S. ecology is considered " megadiverse ": about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. [ 153 ] The United States is home to more than 400 mammal, 750 bird, and 500 reptile and amphibian species. [ 154 ] About 91,000 insect species have been described. [ 155 ] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself. [ 156 ]
There are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas. [ 157 ] Altogether, the government owns 28.8% of the country's land area. [ 158 ] Most of this is protected , though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; 2.4% is used for military purposes. [ 158 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ]
Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy , dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation , [ 161 ] [ 162 ] and international responses to global warming. [ 163 ] [ 164 ] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. [ 165 ] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. [ 166 ] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the country's population now to be 319,123,000, [ 5 ] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900. [ 169 ] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India , the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected. [ 170 ]
The United States has a very diverse population —31 ancestry groups have more than one million members. [ 171 ] German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) - followed by Irish Americans (circa 35 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 27 million). [ 172 ]
White Americans are the largest racial group ; Black Americans are the nation's largest racial minority and third largest ancestry group. [ 171 ] Asian Americans are the country's second largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans , Filipino Americans , and Indian Americans . [ 171 ]
The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 35% below the world average. Nevertheless, its population growth rate is positive at 0.9%, significantly higher than that of many developed nations. [ 173 ] In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification ) were granted legal residence . [ 174 ] Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act . China , India , and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year. [ 175 ] [ 176 ] As of 2012, approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants . [ 177 ]
According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.5% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual , bisexual , or transgender . [ 178 ] A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT . The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. [ 179 ] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual. [ 180 ]
In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively). [ 181 ] The census counted more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were "unable to identify with any" of its five official race categories in 2010. [ 181 ]
The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend . The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent [ 181 ] are identified as sharing a distinct " ethnicity " by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent . [ 182 ] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%. [ 183 ] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born , with 54% of that figure born in Latin America . [ 184 ]
Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic (of any race) woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1). [ 185 ] Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010, [ 186 ] and over 50% of children under age one, [ 187 ] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042. [ 188 ] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white. [ 185 ]
About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs); [ 149 ] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. [ 189 ] In 2008, 273 incorporated places had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million ( New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston ). [ 190 ] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. [ 191 ] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. [ 192 ] The metro areas of Dallas , Houston, Atlanta , and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008. [ 191 ]

English ( American English ) is the de facto national language . Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements —standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish , spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in 28 states. [ 9 ]
Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law. [ 198 ] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French . [ 199 ] Other states, such as California , mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms. [ 200 ] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions.
Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan [ 201 ] and Chamorro [ 202 ] are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; [ 203 ] Cherokee is officially recognized by the Cherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma; [ 204 ] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there. [ 205 ]
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment . Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation. [ 207 ] In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi. [ 208 ] As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. [ 209 ] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion is declining, [ 210 ] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. [ 211 ]
According to a 2014 survey, 78.5% of adults identified themselves as Christian , [ 212 ] Protestant denominations accounted for 51.3%, while Roman Catholicism , at 23.9%, was the largest individual denomination. [ 213 ] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2012 was 4.9%, up from 4% in 2007. [ 213 ] Other religions include Judaism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). [ 213 ] The survey also reported that 16.1% of Americans described themselves as agnostic , atheist or simply having no religion , up from 8.2% in 1990. [ 213 ] [ 214 ] [ 215 ] There are also Baha'i , Sikh , Jain , Shinto , Confucian , Taoist , Druid , Native American , Wiccan , humanist and deist communities. [ 216 ]
Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination. About 26 percent of Americans identify as Evangelical Protestants , while 18 percent are Mainline and 7 percent belong to a traditionally Black church. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew due to Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island is the only state where a majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe . North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho , Nevada and Wyoming .
The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States. [ 208 ]
In 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married. [ 217 ] Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's degrees . [ 218 ]
The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate, 79.8 per 1,000 women, is the highest among OECD nations. [ 219 ] Between 2007 and 2010, the highest teenage birth rate was in Mississippi , and the lowest in New Hampshire . [ 220 ] Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade , a 1973 landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court . While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations. [ 221 ] In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women. [ 222 ] The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman. [ 223 ] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries). [ 224 ] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide. [ 225 ] The legal status of same-sex couples adopting varies by jurisdiction. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S. [ 226 ]
The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation . It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy , "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law ". [ 227 ] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document. [ 228 ] For 2013, the U.S. ranked 19th on the Democracy Index [ 229 ] and 19th on the Corruption Perceptions Index . [ 230 ]
In the American federalist system , citizens are usually subject to three levels of government : federal, state, and local. The local government 's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments . In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels. [ 231 ]
The federal government is composed of three branches:
The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census , seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53. [ 236 ]
The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice . The president is not elected by direct vote , but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia . [ 237 ] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States , has nine members, who serve for life. [ 238 ]
The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature. [ 239 ] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.
The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the "great writ" of habeas corpus . The Constitution has been amended 27 times; [ 240 ] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights , and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803) [ 241 ] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall . [ 242 ]
The United States is a federal union of 50 states. The original 13 states were the successors of the 13 colonies that rebelled against British rule. Early in the country's history, three new states were organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing states: Kentucky from Virginia ; Tennessee from North Carolina ; and Maine from Massachusetts . Most of the other states have been carved from territories obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. One set of exceptions includes Vermont , Texas , and Hawaii : each was a well-established independent republic before joining the union. During the American Civil War , West Virginia broke away from Virginia. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on August 21, 1959. [ 243 ] The states do not have the right to unilaterally secede from the union. [ 244 ]
The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass. The District of Columbia is a federal district which contains the capital of the United States, Washington D.C . The United States also possesses five major overseas territories: Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands in the Caribbean; and American Samoa , Guam , and the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific. [ 245 ] Those born in the major territories are birthright U.S. citizens except Samoans. Samoans born in American Samoa are born U.S. nationals , and may become naturalized citizens. [ 246 ] American citizens residing in the territories have fundamental constitutional protections and elective self-government, with a territorial Member of Congress , but they do not vote for president as states. Territories have personal and business tax regimes different from that of states. [ 247 ]
The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the Native Nations. Though reservations are within state borders, the reservation is a sovereign entity. While the United States recognizes this sovereignty, other countries may not. [ 248 ]

The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history. [ 249 ] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections . Since the general election of 1856 , the major parties have been the Democratic Party , founded in 1824 , and the Republican Party , founded in 1854 . Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt , running as a Progressive in 1912 —has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party . The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.
Within American political culture , the Republican Party is considered center-right or conservative and the Democratic Party is considered center-left or liberal . [ 250 ] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as " blue states ", are relatively liberal. The " red states " of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.
The winner of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections , Democrat Barack Obama , is the 44th U.S. president .
In the 113th United States Congress , the House of Representatives is controlled by the Republican Party, while the Democratic Party has control of the Senate . The Senate currently consists of 53 Democrats, two independents who caucus with the Democrats, and 45 Republicans; the House consists of 233 Republicans and 199 Democrats, with three vacancies. [ 251 ] There are 29 Republican and 21 Democratic state governors . [ 252 ]
Since the founding of the United States until the 2000s, the country's governance has been primarily dominated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs). However, the situation has changed recently and of the top 17 positions (four national candidates of the two major party in the 2012 U.S. presidential election , four leaders in 112th United States Congress , and nine Supreme Court Justices ) there is only one WASP. [ 253 ] [ 254 ] [ 255 ]
The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters . It is a member of the G7 , [ 256 ] G20 , and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions . However, Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Bhutan , and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still supplies Taiwan with military equipment ). [ 257 ]
The United States has a " special relationship " with the United Kingdom [ 258 ] and strong ties with Canada , [ 259 ] Australia , [ 260 ] New Zealand , [ 261 ] the Philippines , [ 262 ] Japan , [ 263 ] South Korea , [ 264 ] Israel , [ 265 ] and several EU countries, including France , Italy , Germany , and Spain . It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico . In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance , the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous. [ 266 ]
The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia , the Marshall Islands and Palau , all of which are Pacific island nations which were part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning after World War II , and gained independence in subsequent years. [ 267 ]
Taxes are levied in the United States at the federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP . [ 268 ] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%). [ 269 ]
U.S. taxation is generally progressive , especially the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world, [ 270 ] [ 271 ] [ 272 ] [ 273 ] [ 274 ] but the incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades. [ 275 ] [ 276 ] [ 277 ] [ 278 ] In 2009 the top 10% of earners, with 36% of the nation's income, paid 78.2% of the federal personal income tax burden, while the bottom 40% had a negative liability. [ 273 ] However, payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax , with no tax charged on income above $113,700 and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. [ 279 ] [ 280 ] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. [ 281 ] [ 282 ] The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. [ 273 ] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. [ 283 ] [ 284 ] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.

During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%). [ 269 ]
The total national debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP), according to an estimate for 2014 by the International Monetary Fund . [ 286 ] In May 2014, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $12.495 trillion, or about 75% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of $17.494 trillion. [ 287 ] [ 288 ] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP. [ 289 ] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's , AAA from Fitch , and Aaa from Moody's . [ 290 ]
Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades, large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies. [ 291 ] However, these concerns are not universally shared. [ 292 ]
The president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army , Navy , Marine Corps , and Air Force . The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors. [ 293 ]
Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System . [ 294 ] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine Expeditionary Units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets . The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad, [ 295 ] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries. [ 296 ] The extent of this global military presence has prompted some scholars to describe the United States as maintaining an "empire of bases". [ 297 ]
The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia . [ 298 ] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA. [ 299 ] Defense's share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011. [ 300 ]
The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. [ 301 ] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011; [ 302 ] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War . [ 303 ] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012; [ 304 ] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan . [ 305 ]
Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff 's departments, with state police providing broader services. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties. [ 307 ] At the federal level and in almost every state, jurisprudence operates on a common law system. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial . [ 308 ] [ 309 ]
In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. [ 310 ] [ 311 ] [ 312 ] Among developed nations, the United States has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. [ 313 ] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2003 showed that United States "homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5 times higher." [ 314 ] Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate . The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes. [ 315 ]
Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 32 states. [ 316 ] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma . [ 317 ] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2010, the country had the fifth highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran , North Korea , and Yemen . [ 318 ]
The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world. [ 319 ] [ 320 ] [ 321 ] [ 322 ] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults. [ 323 ] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980. [ 324 ] African-American males are jailed at about six times the rate of white males and three times the rate of Hispanic males. [ 325 ] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies . [ 326 ] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate , and Maine the lowest. [ 327 ] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest. [ 328 ]
The United States has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity. [ 337 ] According to the International Monetary Fund , the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP). [ 6 ] Its national GDP was about 5% larger at PPP in 2014 than the European Union 's, whose population is around 62% higher. [ 338 ] However, the US's nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014, which is about 5% smaller than that of the European Union. [ 339 ] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7 . [ 340 ] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP . [ 6 ] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency . [ 341 ]
The United States is the largest importer of goods and second largest exporter , though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion. [ 342 ] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners. [ 343 ] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest export. [ 342 ] China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt. [ 344 ] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve , who hold the majority of the debt. [ 345 ] [ 346 ] [ 347 ] [ 348 ]
In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%. [ 349 ] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power. [ 350 ] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing. [ 351 ]
Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field. [ 352 ] The United States is the third largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its largest importer. [ 353 ] It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas , sulfur, phosphates, and salt . While agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP, [ 350 ] the United States is the world's top producer of corn [ 354 ] and soybeans. [ 355 ] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics [ dead link ] for products that include peanuts , oats , rye , wheat , rice , cotton , corn , barley , hay , sunflowers , and oilseeds . In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef , poultry , pork , and dairy products . The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium , copper , lead , magnesium , zinc , titanium and others. [ 356 ] [ 357 ] In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world. [ 358 ]
Consumer spending comprises 71% of the U.S. economy in 2013. [ 359 ] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized , compared to 30% in Western Europe. [ 360 ] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. [ 361 ] The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation [ 362 ] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right , with the others being Papua New Guinea , Suriname and Liberia . [ 363 ] In 2009, the United States had the third highest labor productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway . It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands . [ 364 ]
The 2008-2012 global recession had a significant impact on the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office . [ 365 ] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence , the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies , an escalating federal debt crisis , inflation , and rising petroleum and food prices . There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed , continued decreasing household income , and tax and federal budget increases . [ 366 ] [ 367 ] [ 368 ] A 2011 poll found that more than half of all Americans think the U.S. is still in recession or even depression , despite official data that shows a historically modest recovery. [ 369 ] In 2013 the Census Bureau defined poverty rate decreased to roughly 14.5% of the population. [ 370 ]
Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second highest median household income . [ 371 ] [ 372 ] According to the Census Bureau real median household income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144 in 2010. [ 373 ] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013. [ 374 ] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation. [ 375 ] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI). [ 376 ]
There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s. [ 377 ] While inflation -adjusted ("real") household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has since been flat and even decreased recently. [ 378 ] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has had a significant impact on income inequality , [ 379 ] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations. [ 380 ] [ 381 ] [ 382 ] The post-recession income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2012. [ 383 ]
Wealth , like income and taxes, is highly concentrated ; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%. [ 384 ] This is the second-highest share among developed nations. [ 385 ] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. [ 386 ] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth is down $14 trillion. [ 387 ] At the end of 2008, household debt amounted to $13.8 trillion. [ 388 ]
There were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2009, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic. [ 389 ]
Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 13 million roads, including one of the world's longest highway systems . [ 391 ] The world's second largest automobile market, [ 392 ] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans. [ 393 ] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs , or light trucks. [ 394 ] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km). [ 395 ]
Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips. [ 396 ] [ 397 ] While transport of goods by rail is extensive, relatively few people use rail to travel, [ 398 ] though ridership on Amtrak , the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. [ 399 ] Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. [ 400 ] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal. [ 401 ]
The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978 , while most major airports are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition of US Airways . [ 402 ] Of the world's 30 busiest passenger airports, 12 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport . [ 403 ]
The United States energy market is 29,000 terawatt hours per year. Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent per year, the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources. [ 404 ] The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum. [ 405 ]
For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident . In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed. [ 406 ] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves. [ 407 ] It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil. [ 408 ]
The United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone . Thomas Edison 's laboratory developed the phonograph , the first long-lasting light bulb , and the first viable movie camera . [ 409 ] In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line . The Wright brothers , in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight . [ 410 ]
The rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein , Enrico Fermi , and John von Neumann , to immigrate to the United States. [ 411 ] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age , while the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory pioneered the advancement of jet-assisted takeoff . The Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science , and computers. [ 412 ] Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Sun Microsystems , IBM , GNU-Linux , Apple Computer , and Microsoft refined and popularized the personal computer . [ 413 ]
The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet . Today, 64% of research and development funding comes from the private sector. [ 414 ] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor . [ 415 ] As of April 2010, 77% of American households owned at least one computer , and 68% had broadband Internet service. [ 416 ] 85% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of 2011. [ 417 ] The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food , representing half of the world's biotech crops. [ 418 ]
American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade ) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade , the end of high school ); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17. [ 419 ] About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools . Just over 2% of children are homeschooled . [ 420 ] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student. [ 421 ] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities . [ 422 ]
The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education . According to prominent international rankings, 13 or 15 American colleges and universities are ranked among the top 20 in the world. [ 423 ] [ 424 ] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree , and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. [ 425 ] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%. [ 149 ] [ 426 ] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world. [ 427 ]
As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending. [ 421 ] [ 428 ] As of 2012, student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards. [ 429 ]
The United States has a life expectancy of 78.4 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990, ranking it 50th among 221 nations, and 27th out of the 34 industrialized OECD countries, down from 20th in 1990. [ 430 ] [ 431 ] Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world. [ 432 ] Obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the world . [ 433 ] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight; [ 434 ] the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled in the last quarter-century. [ 435 ] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals. [ 436 ] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224 countries. [ 437 ]
In 2010, coronary artery disease , lung cancer , stroke , chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases , and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression , musculoskeletal disorders , neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure , high blood sugar , physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease , drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates. [ 431 ] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations.
The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five. Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine than the rest of the world. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP. [ 440 ] Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal . In 2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population did not carry health insurance . The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. [ 441 ] [ 442 ] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. [ 443 ] Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of controversy. [ 444 ] [ 445 ]
The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. [ 19 ] [ 446 ] Aside from the relatively small Native American and Native Hawaiian populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. [ 447 ] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa . [ 19 ] [ 448 ] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot , and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics. [ 19 ]
Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic , competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed " emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government. [ 449 ] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%. [ 450 ] [ 451 ]
The American Dream , or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility , plays a key role in attracting immigrants. [ 452 ] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. [ 453 ] [ 454 ] [ 455 ] [ 456 ] [ 340 ] [ 457 ] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society , [ 458 ] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization , language, and values. [ 459 ] Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. [ 460 ] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute. [ 461 ]
The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. Americans are the heaviest television viewers in the world, [ 462 ] and the average viewing time continues to rise, reaching five hours a day in 2006. [ 463 ] The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. [ 464 ]
In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public and/or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.)
Aside from web portals and search engines , the most popular websites are Facebook , YouTube , Wikipedia , Amazon , eBay , and Twitter . [ 465 ]
Well-known newspapers are The New York Times , USA Today and The Wall Street Journal . Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy , which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily paper(s), for example, New York City's Village Voice or Los Angeles' L.A. Weekly , to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.
In Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue behind English, more than 800 publications are published. [ 466 ] [ 467 ]
The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison 's Kinetoscope . The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film 's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood , California.
Director D. W. Griffith was central to the development of film grammar and Orson Welles 's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time. [ 468 ] [ 469 ] American screen actors like John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe have become iconic figures, while producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising . Hollywood is also one of the leaders in motion picture production. [ 470 ]
Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman , the quintessential comic book superhero of DC Comics , developed into an American icon. [ 471 ] Additional comic book publishers include; Marvel Comics , created in 1939, Image Comics , created in 1992, Dark Horse Comics , created in 1986, and numerous small press comic book companies. In celebration of the industry's success, annual comic conventions take place at The San Diego Comic-Con International , which has an attendance of over 130,000 visitors.
The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. [ 472 ]
Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll . In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk . More recent American creations include hip hop and house music . American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson , and Madonna have become global celebrities. [ 472 ]
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne , Edgar Allan Poe , and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson , virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet. [ 473 ] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), and F. Scott Fitzgerald 's The Great Gatsby (1925)—may be dubbed the " Great American Novel ". [ 474 ]
Eleven U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature , most recently Toni Morrison in 1993. William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century. [ 475 ] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth , Thomas Pynchon , and Don DeLillo .
The transcendentalists , led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson , established the first major American philosophical movement . After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism . In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty , and later Noam Chomsky , brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy . Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Globally influential Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman , James M. Buchanan , and Thomas Sowell have transcended discipline to impact various fields in social and political philosophy. [ 476 ] [ 477 ]
In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism . The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art , shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. [ 478 ] Georgia O'Keeffe , Marsden Hartley , and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright , Philip Johnson , and Frank Gehry .
One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum , who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway ; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin , Cole Porter , and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards . Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams , Edward Albee , and August Wilson .
Though little known at the time, Charles Ives 's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance , while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography , with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz , Edward Steichen , and Ansel Adams .
Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain. Traditional American cuisine uses indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. [ 479 ]
Slow-cooked pork and beef barbecue, crab cakes, potato chips, and chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American foods. Soul food , developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana Creole , Cajun , and Tex-Mex are regionally important. The confectionery industry in the United States includes The Hershey Company , the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America. In addition, Frito-Lay , a subsidiary of PepsiCo , is the largest globally distributed snack food company in the world. The United States has a vast breakfast cereal industry that includes brands such as Kellogg's and General Mills .
Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed. [ 480 ] Americans generally prefer coffee to tea. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages. [ 481 ] [ 482 ]
The American fast food industry, the world's largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1930s. Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%; [ 480 ] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American " obesity epidemic ". [ 483 ] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake. [ 484 ]
While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball , volleyball , skateboarding , and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. [ 485 ] The Iroquois field their own separate national team, the Iroquois Nationals , in recognition of the confederacy's creation of lacrosse. Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games , more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games , the second most behind Norway . [ 486 ]
The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined. [ 487 ] Baseball has been regarded as the national sport since the late 19th century, while American football is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport. [ 488 ] Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports. These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences. [ 489 ] Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports , [ 490 ] but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing , particularly NASCAR . [ 491 ] In the 21st century, televised mixed martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular viewers. [ 492 ] [ 493 ] While soccer is less popular in the United States than in many other nations, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup , the men's national soccer team has been to the past six World Cups and the women are first in the women's world rankings .

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland i / ɡ r eɪ t ˈ b r ɪ t (ə) n ə n d ˈ n ɔː ð (ə) n ˈ ʌ ɪ ə l ə n d / , commonly known as the United Kingdom ( UK ) or Britain , is a sovereign state in Europe . Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland , the country includes the island of Great Britain (a term also applied loosely to refer to the whole country), [ 8 ] the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland , and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland . [ nb 4 ] Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe .
The United Kingdom is the 22nd-most populous country , with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. [ 3 ] It is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Its capital city is London , an important global city and financial centre with the fourth-largest urban area in Europe. [ 11 ] The current monarch —since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II . The UK consists of four countries : England , Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland . [ 12 ] The latter three have devolved administrations, [ 13 ] each with varying powers, [ 14 ] [ 15 ] based in their capitals, Edinburgh , Cardiff , and Belfast , respectively. Guernsey , Jersey , and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. [ 16 ] The UK has fourteen Overseas Territories , [ 17 ] including the disputed Falkland Islands , Gibraltar , and Indian Ocean Territory .
The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time . Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, which in 1801, merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the country, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. [ nb 5 ] British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies , are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history . British influence can be observed in the language , culture , and legal systems of many of its former colonies .
The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest by purchasing power parity . The country is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index , currently ranking 14th in the world . It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific, and political influence internationally. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fifth or sixth in the world. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member state of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe , the G7 , the G8 , the G20 , NATO , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).



The 1707 Acts of Union declared that the kingdoms of England and Scotland were "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain ", though the new state is also referred to in the Acts as the "Kingdom of Great Britain", "United Kingdom of Great Britain" and "United Kingdom". [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ nb 6 ] However, the term "united kingdom" is only found in informal use during the 18th century and the country was only occasionally referred to as he "United Kingdom of Great Britain". [ 26 ] The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland in 1801, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . The name "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" was adopted following the independence of the Irish Free State , and the partition of Ireland , in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the UK. [ 27 ]
Although the United Kingdom, as a sovereign state, is a country, England, Scotland, Wales, and to a lesser degree, Northern Ireland, are also regarded as countries , though they are not sovereign states. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved self-government. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The British Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a country" to describe the United Kingdom. [ 12 ] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions of the UK , also refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as "regions". [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a "province". [ 28 ] [ 34 ] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences." [ 35 ]
The term Britain is often used as synonym for the United Kingdom. The term Great Britain , by contrast, refers conventionally to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] However, it is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] GB and GBR are the standard country codes for the United Kingdom (see ISO 3166-2 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 ) and are consequently used by international organisations to refer to the United Kingdom. Additionally, the United Kingdom's Olympic team competes under the name "Great Britain" or "Team GB". [ 41 ] [ 42 ]
The adjective British is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom. The term has no definite legal connotation, but is used in law to refer to UK citizenship and matters to do with nationality . [ 43 ] People of the United Kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British ; or as being English , Scottish , Welsh , Northern Irish , or Irish ; [ 44 ] or as being both. [ 45 ]
In 2006, a new design of British passport was introduced. Its first page shows the long form name of the state in English, Welsh and Scottish Gaelic . [ 46 ] In Welsh, the long form name of the state is "Teyrnas Unedig Prydain Fawr a Gogledd Iwerddon" with "Teyrnas Unedig" being used as a short form name on government websites. [ 47 ] In Scottish Gaelic, the long form is "Rìoghachd Aonaichte Bhreatainn is Èireann a Tuath" and the short form "Rìoghachd Aonaichte".
Settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago . [ 48 ] By the end of the region's prehistoric period , the population is thought to have belonged, in the main, to a culture termed Insular Celtic , comprising Brythonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland . [ 49 ] The Roman conquest , beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain , was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brythonic area mainly to what was to become Wales and the historic Kingdom of Strathclyde . [ 50 ] Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century. [ 51 ] Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) [ 52 ] [ 53 ] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. [ 54 ]
In 1066, the Normans invaded England from France and after its conquest , seized large parts of Wales , conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland , bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture. [ 55 ] The Norman elites greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, each of the local cultures. [ 56 ] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and made an unsuccessful attempt to annex Scotland . Thereafter, Scotland maintained its independence, albeit in near-constant conflict with England . The English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years War , while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period. [ 57 ]
The early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country. [ 58 ] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England , [ 59 ] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown. [ 60 ] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. [ 61 ]
In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots , inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]
In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War ) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
Although the monarchy was restored, it ensured (with the Glorious Revolution of 1688) that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system . [ 66 ] During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power (and the interest in voyages of discovery ) led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies , particularly in North America. [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
On 1 May 1707, the united kingdom of Great Britain came into being, the result of Acts of Union being passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland to ratify the 1706 Treaty of Union and so unite the two kingdoms. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]
In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole , in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite Uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the British throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart . The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were brutally suppressed. The British colonies in North America that broke away from Britain in the American War of Independence became the United States of America in 1782. British imperial ambition turned elsewhere, particularly to India . [ 72 ]
During the 18th century, Britain was involved in the Atlantic slave trade . British ships transported an estimated 2 million slaves from Africa to the West Indies before banning the trade in 1807. [ 73 ] The term 'United Kingdom' became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union , uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . [ 74 ]
In the early 19th century, the British-led Industrial Revolution began to transform the country. It slowly led to a shift in political power away from the old Tory and Whig landowning classes towards the new industrialists. An alliance of merchants and industrialists with the Whigs would lead to a new party, the Liberals , with an ideology of free trade and laissez-faire . In 1832 Parliament passed the Great Reform Act , which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes. In the countryside, enclosure of the land was driving small farmers out. Towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class. Few ordinary workers had the vote, and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unions .
After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), the UK emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). [ 75 ] Unchallenged at sea , British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica . [ 76 ] [ 77 ] By the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, Britain was described as the "workshop of the world". [ 78 ] The British Empire was expanded to include India , large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, Argentina and Siam . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During the century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. [ 81 ] After 1875, the UK's industrial monopoly was challenged by Germany and the USA. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa and elsewhere. Canada, Australia and New Zealand became self-governing dominions. [ 82 ]
Social reform and home rule for Ireland were important domestic issues after 1900. The Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small Socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote before 1914.
The UK fought with France, Russia and (after 1917) the US, against Germany and its allies in World War I (1914–18). [ 83 ] The UK armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western front . [ 84 ] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order.
After the war, the UK received the League of Nations mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. The British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population. [ 85 ] However, the UK had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. [ 84 ] The rise of Irish Nationalism and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921, [ 86 ] and the Irish Free State became independent with Dominion status in 1922. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. [ 87 ] A wave of strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the UK General Strike of 1926 . The UK had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the Great Depression (1929–32) occurred. This led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s. A coalition government was formed in 1931. [ 88 ]
The UK entered World War II by declaring war on Germany in 1939, after it had invaded Poland and Czechoslovakia . In 1940, Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war, the UK continued the fight alone against Germany. In 1940, the RAF defeated the German Luftwaffe in a struggle for control of the skies in the Battle of Britain . The UK suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz . There were also eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic , the North Africa campaign and Burma campaign . UK forces played an important role in the Normandy landings of 1944, achieved with its ally the US. After Germany's defeat, the UK was one of the Big Three powers who met to plan the post-war world; it was an original signatory to the Declaration of the United Nations . The UK became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . However, the war left the UK severely weakened and depending financially on Marshall Aid and loans from the United States. [ 89 ]
In the immediate post-war years, the Labour government initiated a radical programme of reforms, which had a significant effect on British society in the following decades. [ 90 ] Major industries and public utilities were nationalised , a Welfare State was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service , was created. [ 91 ] The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's now much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947. [ 92 ] Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence. Many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations . [ 93 ]
Although the UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test in 1952), the new post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture . From the 1960s onward, its popular culture was also influential abroad. As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the UK government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries . In the following decades, the UK became a multi-ethnic society. [ 94 ] Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was not as successful as many of its competitors, such as West Germany and Japan. In 1973, the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC), and when the EEC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, it was one of the 12 founding members.
From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as the Troubles . It is usually considered to have ended with the Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement of 1998. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ]
Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative Government of the 1980s initiated a radical policy of monetarism , deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, Big Bang in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies ( privatisation ), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others. [ 98 ] This resulted in high unemployment and social unrest, but ultimately also economic growth, particularly in the services sector. From 1984, the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues. [ 99 ]
Around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. [ 13 ] [ 100 ] The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights . The UK is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily. It plays leading roles in the EU, UN and NATO. However, controversy surrounds some of Britain's overseas military deployments , particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq . [ 101 ]
The 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the UK economy. The coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted. [ 102 ] In 2014 the Scottish Government held a referendum on Scottish independence , with the majority of voters rejecting the independence proposal and opting to remain within the United Kingdom. [ 103 ]
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the British Isles [ 104 ] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the south-east coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel . [ 105 ] In 1993 10% of the UK was forested, 46% used for pastures and 25% cultivated for agriculture. [ 106 ] The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London is the defining point of the Prime Meridian . [ 107 ]
The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49° to 61° N , and longitudes 9° W to 2° E . Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland. [ 105 ] The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long. [ 108 ] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel , which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world. [ 109 ]
England accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK, covering 130,395 square kilometres (50,350 sq mi). [ 110 ] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, [ 106 ] with mountainous terrain north-west of the Tees-Exe line ; including the Cumbrian Mountains of the Lake District, the Pennines and limestone hills of the Peak District , Exmoor and Dartmoor . The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames , Severn and the Humber . England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike (978 metres (3,209 ft)) in the Lake District . Its principal rivers are the Severn, Thames, Humber, Tees, Tyne, Tweed, Avon, Exe and Mersey. [ 106 ]
Scotland accounts for just under a third of the total area of the UK, covering 78,772 square kilometres (30,410 sq mi) [ 111 ] and including nearly eight hundred islands , [ 112 ] predominantly west and north of the mainland; notably the Hebrides , Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands . The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault – a geological rock fracture – which traverses Scotland from Arran in the west to Stonehaven in the east. [ 113 ] The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the Highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including Ben Nevis which at 1,343 metres (4,406 ft) is the highest point in the British Isles. [ 114 ] Lowland areas – especially the narrow waist of land between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth known as the Central Belt – are flatter and home to most of the population including Glasgow , Scotland's largest city, and Edinburgh , its capital and political centre.
Wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK, covering 20,779 square kilometres (8,020 sq mi). [ 115 ] Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales . The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff , Swansea and Newport , and the South Wales Valleys to their north. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon ( Welsh : Yr Wyddfa ) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales. [ 106 ] The 14, or possibly 15, Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914 m) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s . Wales has over 2,704 kilometres (1,680 miles) of coastline. [ 116 ] Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey ( Ynys Môn ) in the northwest.
Northern Ireland , separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel , has an area of 14,160 square kilometres (5,470 sq mi) and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at 388 square kilometres (150 sq mi), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area. [ 117 ] The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft). [ 106 ]
The United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round. [ 105 ] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below −11 °C (12 °F ) or rising above 35 °C (95 °F). [ 118 ] The prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, [ 105 ] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream , bring mild winters; especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south-east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.
Each country of the United Kingdom has its own system of administrative and geographic demarcation, whose origins often pre-date the formation of the United Kingdom. Thus there is "no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom". [ 119 ] Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function. [ 120 ] Change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either.
The organisation of local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. Legislation concerning local government in England is the responsibility of the UK parliament and the Government of the United Kingdom , as England has no devolved parliament. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine Government office regions or European Union government office regions. [ 121 ] One region, Greater London , has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum . [ 122 ] It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies , but a proposed assembly in the North East region was rejected by a referendum in 2004 . [ 123 ] Below the regional tier, some parts of England have county councils and district councils and others have unitary authorities ; while London consists of 32 London boroughs and the City of London . Councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member wards. [ 124 ]
For local government purposes , Scotland is divided into 32 council areas , with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of Glasgow , Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are currently 1,222; [ 125 ] they are paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a Provost , or Convenor , to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area. Councillors are subject to a code of conduct enforced by the Standards Commission for Scotland . [ 126 ] The representative association of Scotland's local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). [ 127 ]
Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport which are unitary authorities in their own right. [ 128 ] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system. [ 129 ] The most recent elections were held in May 2012, except for the Isle of Anglesey . The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local authorities in Wales. [ 130 ]
Local government in Northern Ireland has since 1973 been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste, controlling dogs and maintaining parks and cemeteries. [ 131 ] On 13 March 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system. [ 132 ] The next local elections were postponed until 2016 to facilitate this. [ 133 ]
The United Kingdom has sovereignty over seventeen territories which do not form part of the United Kingdom itself: fourteen British Overseas Territories [ 136 ] and three Crown dependencies. [ 137 ]
The fourteen British Overseas Territories are: Anguilla ; Bermuda ; the British Antarctic Territory ; the British Indian Ocean Territory ; the British Virgin Islands ; the Cayman Islands ; the Falkland Islands ; Gibraltar ; Montserrat ; Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha ; the Turks and Caicos Islands ; the Pitcairn Islands ; South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ; and Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus . [ 138 ] British claims in Antarctica are not universally recognised. [ 139 ] Collectively Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 1,727,570 square kilometres (667,018 sq mi) and a population of approximately 260,000 people. [ 140 ] They are the remnants of the British Empire and several have specifically voted to remain British territories (Bermuda in 1995 , Gibraltar in 2002 and the Falkland Islands in 2013 ). [ 141 ]
The Crown dependencies are possessions of the Crown , as opposed to overseas territories of the UK. [ 142 ] They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. However, internationally, they are regarded as "territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible". [ 143 ] The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown ( Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor). [ 144 ] Since 2005 each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government . [ 145 ]
The United Kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy . Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK as well as monarch of fifteen other independent Commonwealth countries . The monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn". [ 146 ] The United Kingdom is one of only four countries in the world to have an uncodified constitution . [ 147 ] [ nb 7 ] The Constitution of the United Kingdom thus consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including statutes , judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions . As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and "constitutional law", the UK Parliament can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing Acts of Parliament , and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. [ 148 ]
The UK has a parliamentary government based on the Westminster system that has been emulated around the world: a legacy of the British Empire. The parliament of the United Kingdom that meets in the Palace of Westminster has two houses; an elected House of Commons and an appointed House of Lords . All bills passed are given Royal Assent before becoming law.
The position of prime minister , [ nb 8 ] the UK's head of government , [ 149 ] belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. The prime minister chooses a cabinet and they are formally appointed by the monarch to form Her Majesty's Government . By convention, the Queen respects the prime minister's decisions of government. [ 150 ]
The cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of a prime minister's party or coalition and mostly from the House of Commons but always from both legislative houses, the cabinet being responsible to both. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom , and become Ministers of the Crown . The current Prime Minister is David Cameron , who has been in office since 11 May 2010. [ 151 ] Cameron is the leader of the Conservative Party and heads a coalition with the Liberal Democrats . For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is currently divided into 650 constituencies , [ 152 ] each electing a single member of parliament (MP) by simple plurality . General elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises. The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 require that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election. [ 153 ]
The UK's three major political parties are the Conservative Party ( Tories ), the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, representing the British traditions of conservatism , socialism and social liberalism , respectively. During the 2010 general election these three parties won 622 out of 650 seats available in the House of Commons. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the UK: the Scottish National Party (Scotland only); Plaid Cymru (Wales only); and the Alliance Party , Democratic Unionist Party , Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Féin (Northern Ireland only [ nb 9 ] ). In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn Féin members of parliament have ever attended the House of Commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own government or executive , led by a First Minister (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, a diarchal First Minister and deputy First Minister ), and a devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively, [ 156 ] on matters that only affect England. [ 157 ] The McKay Commission reported on this matter in March 2013 recommending that laws affecting only England should need support from a majority of English members of parliament. [ 158 ]
The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK parliament, including education , healthcare , Scots law and local government . [ 159 ] At the 2011 elections the Scottish National Party won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament, with its leader, Alex Salmond , as First Minister of Scotland . [ 160 ] [ 161 ] In 2012, the UK and Scottish governments signed the Edinburgh Agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, which was defeated 55% to 45%.
The Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland. [ 162 ] The Assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through Acts of the Assembly , which require no prior consent from Westminster. The 2011 elections resulted in a minority Labour administration led by Carwyn Jones . [ 163 ]
The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly. Currently, Peter Robinson (Democratic Unionist Party) and Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin) are First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively. [ 164 ] Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the North-South Ministerial Council , where the Northern Ireland Executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the Government of Ireland . The British and Irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting Northern Ireland through the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference , which assumes the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland administration in the event of its non-operation.
The UK does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty , the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. [ 165 ] [ 166 ] Indeed, in 1972, the UK Parliament unilaterally prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland , setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions. [ 167 ] In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions. [ 168 ] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are even greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland . [ 169 ]
The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system, as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system. [ 170 ] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law : English law , Northern Ireland law and Scots law . A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords . [ 171 ] [ 172 ] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies . [ 173 ]
Both English law, which applies in England and Wales , and Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles. [ 174 ] The essence of common law is that, subject to statute, the law is developed by judges in courts, applying statute, precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and binding in future similar cases ( stare decisis ). [ 175 ] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales , consisting of the Court of Appeal , the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions. [ 176 ]
Scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session , for civil cases, [ 177 ] and the High Court of Justiciary , for criminal cases. [ 178 ] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law. [ 179 ] Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary Court. [ 180 ] The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial: " guilty ", " not guilty " and " not proven ". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an acquittal. [ 181 ]
Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/08, [ 182 ] according to crime statistics . The prison population of England and Wales has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. [ 183 ] Her Majesty's Prison Service , which reports to the Ministry of Justice , manages most of the prisons within England and Wales. Crime in Scotland fell to its lowest recorded level for 32 years in 2009/10, falling by ten per cent. [ 184 ] At the same time Scotland's prison population, at over 8,000, [ 185 ] is at record levels and well above design capacity. [ 186 ] The Scottish Prison Service , which reports to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice , manages Scotland's prisons.
The UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , a member of NATO , the Commonwealth of Nations , G7 , G8 , G20 , the OECD , the WTO , the Council of Europe , the OSCE , and is a member state of the European Union . The UK is said to have a " Special Relationship " with the United States and a close partnership with France—the " Entente cordiale "—and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council . Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements. [ 189 ]
The armed forces of the United Kingdom—officially, Her Majesty's Armed Forces —consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service ), the British Army and the Royal Air Force . [ 190 ] The forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council , chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence . The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch , Elizabeth II , to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance. [ 191 ] The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO , including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps , as well as the Five Power Defence Arrangements , RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island , Belize , Brunei , Canada , Cyprus , Diego Garcia , the Falkland Islands , Germany , Gibraltar , Kenya and Qatar . [ 192 ]
The British armed forces played a key role in establishing the British Empire as the dominant world power in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Throughout its unique history the British forces have seen action in a number of major wars, such as the Seven Years' War , the Napoleonic Wars , the Crimean War , World War I and World War II —as well as many colonial conflicts. By emerging victorious from such conflicts, Britain has often been able to decisively influence world events . Since the end of the British Empire, the UK has nonetheless remained a major military power. Following the end of the Cold War , defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" will be undertaken as part of a coalition. [ 193 ] Setting aside the intervention in Sierra Leone , recent UK military operations in Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan , Iraq and, most recently, Libya , have followed this approach. The last time the British military fought alone was the Falklands War of 1982.
According to various sources, including the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies , the United Kingdom has the fifth- or sixth-highest military expenditure in the world. Total defence spending currently accounts for around 2.4% of total national GDP. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
The UK has a partially regulated market economy . [ 194 ] Based on market exchange rates the UK is today the sixth-largest economy in the world and the third-largest in Europe after Germany and France, having fallen behind France for the first time in over a decade in 2008. [ 195 ] HM Treasury , led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , is responsible for developing and executing the British government's public finance policy and economic policy . The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling . Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. Pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency (after the US Dollar and the Euro). [ 196 ] Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee , headed by the Governor of the Bank of England , has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year. [ 197 ]
The UK service sector makes up around 73% of GDP. [ 198 ] London is one of the three "command centres" of the global economy (alongside New York City and Tokyo), [ 199 ] it is the world's largest financial centre alongside New York, [ 200 ] [ 201 ] [ 202 ] and it has the largest city GDP in Europe. [ 203 ] Edinburgh is also one of the largest financial centres in Europe. [ 204 ] Tourism is very important to the British economy and, with over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world and London has the most international visitors of any city in the world. [ 205 ] [ 206 ] The creative industries accounted for 7% GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6% per annum between 1997 and 2005. [ 207 ]
The Industrial Revolution started in the UK with an initial concentration on the textile industry, [ 208 ] followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding , coal mining and steelmaking . [ 209 ] [ 210 ]
The empire was exploited as an overseas market for British products, allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century. As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7% of national output in 2003. [ 211 ]
The automotive industry is a significant part of the UK manufacturing sector and employs over 800,000 people, with a turnover of some £52 billion, generating £26.6 billion of exports. [ 212 ]
The aerospace industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest national aerospace industry in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £20 billion. The wings for the Airbus A380 and the A350 XWB are designed and manufactured at Airbus UK 's world-leading Broughton facility, whilst over a quarter of the value of the Boeing 787 comes from UK manufacturers including Eaton (fuel subsystem pumps), Messier-Bugatti-Dowty (the landing gear) and Rolls-Royce (the engines). Other key names include GKN Aerospace – an expert in metallic and composite aerostructures that's involved in almost every civil and military fixed and rotary wing aircraft in production and development today. [ 213 ] [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ]
BAE Systems - plays a critical role on some of the world's biggest defence aerospace projects. The company makes large sections of the Typhoon Eurofighter at its sub-assembly plant in Salmesbury and assembles the aircraft for the RAF at its Warton Plant, near Preston. It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter - the world's largest single defence project - for which it designs and manufactures a range of components including the aft fuselage, vertical and horizontal tail and wing tips and fuel system. As well as this it manufactures the Hawk , the world's most successful jet training aircraft. [ 216 ] Airbus UK also manufactures the wings for the A400m military transporter. Rolls-Royce , is the world's second-largest aero-engine manufacturer. Its engines power more than 30 types of commercial aircraft and it has more than 30,000 engines currently in service across both the civil and defence sectors. Agusta Westland designs and manufactures complete helicopters in the UK. [ 216 ]
The UK space industry is growing very fast. Worth £9.1bn in 2011 and employing 29,000 people, it is growing at a rate of some 7.5 per cent annually, according to its umbrella organisation, the UK Space Agency . Government strategy is for the space industry to be a £40bn business for the UK by 2030, capturing a 10 per cent share of the $250bn world market for commercial space technology. [ 216 ] On 16 July 2013, the British government pledged £60m to the Skylon project: this investment will provide support at a "crucial stage" to allow a full-scale prototype of the SABRE engine to be built.
The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the UK economy and the country has the third-highest share of global pharmaceutical R&D expenditures (after the United States and Japan). [ 217 ] [ 218 ]
Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with less than 1.6% of the labour force (535,000 workers). [ 219 ] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. Farmers are subsidised by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy . The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a number of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land.
In the final quarter of 2008 the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991. [ 220 ] Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January 2012 the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to 22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992. [ 221 ] [ 222 ] Total UK government debt rose from 44.4% of GDP in 2007 to 82.9% of GDP in 2011. [ 223 ] In February 2013, the UK lost its top AAA credit rating for the first time since 1978. [ 224 ]
Inflation -adjusted wages in the UK fell by 3.2% between the third quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2012. [ 225 ] Since the 1980s, economic inequality has grown faster in the UK than in any other developed country. [ 226 ]
The poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. [ nb 10 ] In 2007–2008 13.5 million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU members. [ 227 ] In the same year 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line after housing costs were taken into account. This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998–1999. [ 228 ] The UK imports 40% of its food supplies. [ 229 ] The Office for National Statistics has estimated that in 2011, 14 million people were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and that one person in 20 (5.1%) was now experiencing "severe material depression," [ 230 ] up from 3 million people in 1977. [ 231 ] [ 232 ]
England and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century [ 233 ] and the United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, [ 208 ] and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. [ 234 ] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton , whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science; [ 235 ] from the 19th century Charles Darwin , whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell , who formulated classical electromagnetic theory ; and more recently Stephen Hawking , who has advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology , quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes . [ 236 ] Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry Cavendish ; [ 237 ] from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming , [ 238 ] and the structure of DNA , by Francis Crick and others. [ 239 ] Major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK in the 18th century include the steam locomotive , developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian ; [ 240 ] from the 19th century the electric motor by Michael Faraday , the incandescent light bulb by Joseph Swan , [ 241 ] and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell ; [ 242 ] and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by John Logie Baird and others, [ 243 ] the jet engine by Frank Whittle , the basis of the modern computer by Alan Turing , and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee . [ 244 ]
Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry. [ 245 ] Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7% of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8% share of scientific citations, the third and second highest in the world (after the United States and China, and the United States, respectively). [ 246 ] Scientific journals produced in the UK include Nature , the British Medical Journal and The Lancet . [ 247 ]
A radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads. [ 105 ] In 2009 there were a total of 34 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain. [ 250 ]
The UK has a railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km) in Great Britain and 189 miles (304 km) in Northern Ireland . Railways in Northern Ireland are operated by NI Railways , a subsidiary of state-owned Translink . In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997. Network Rail owns and manages most of the fixed assets (tracks, signals etc.). About 20 privately owned (and foreign state-owned railways including: Deutsche Bahn ; SNCF and Nederlandse Spoorwegen ) Train Operating Companies (including state-owned East Coast ), operate passenger trains and carry over 18,000 passenger trains daily. There are also some 1,000 freight trains in daily operation. [ 105 ] The UK government is to spend £30 billion on a new high-speed railway line, HS2 , to be operational by 2025. [ 251 ] Crossrail , under construction in London, Is Europe's largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost. [ 252 ] [ 253 ]
In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers. [ 254 ] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers). [ 254 ] London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world [ 248 ] [ 249 ] and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways , as well as for BMI and Virgin Atlantic . [ 255 ]
In 2006, the UK was the world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer. [ 256 ] The UK is home to a number of large energy companies, including two of the six oil and gas " supermajors " – BP and Royal Dutch Shell – and BG Group . [ 257 ] [ 258 ] In 2011, 40% of the UK's electricity was produced by gas, 30% by coal, 19% by nuclear power and 4.2% by wind, hydro, biofuels and wastes. [ 259 ]
In 2009, the UK produced 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1.7 million bbl/d. [ 260 ] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005. [ 260 ] In 2010 [update] the UK had around 3.1 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves , the largest of any EU member state. [ 260 ] In 2009, 66.5% of the UK's oil supply was imported. [ 261 ]
In 2009, the UK was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU. [ 262 ] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004. [ 262 ] In 2009, half of British gas was supplied from imports and this is expected to increase to at least 75% by 2015, as domestic reserves are depleted. [ 259 ]
Coal production played a key role in the UK economy in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the mid-1970s, 130 million tonnes of coal was being produced annually, not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s. During the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably. In 2011, the UK produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal. [ 263 ] In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons. [ 263 ] The UK Coal Authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or ' fracking ', [ 264 ] and that, based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years. [ 265 ] However, environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes. [ 266 ] [ 267 ]
In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25% of total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability. In 2012, the UK had 16 reactors normally generating about 19% of its electricity. All but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023. Unlike Germany and Japan, the UK intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018. [ 259 ]
A census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the UK every ten years. [ 268 ] The Office for National Statistics is responsible for collecting data for England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries. [ 269 ] In the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775. [ 270 ] It is the third-largest in the European Union, the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 21st-largest in the world. 2010 was the third successive year in which natural change contributed more to population growth than net long-term international migration. [ 271 ] [ 271 ] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent. [ 270 ] This compares to 0.3 per cent per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 per cent in the decade 1981 to 1991. [ 271 ] The 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 0–14 has nearly halved (31 per cent in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011) and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than trebled (from 5 to 16 per cent). [ 270 ] It has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080. [ 272 ]
England's population in 2011 was found to be 53 million. [ 273 ] It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 383 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2003, [ 274 ] with a particular concentration in London and the south-east. [ 275 ] The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million, [ 276 ] Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million. [ 273 ] In percentage terms England has had the fastest growing population of any country of the UK in the period from 2001 to 2011, with an increase of 7.9%.
In 2012 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.92 children per woman. [ 277 ] While a rising birth rate is contributing to current population growth, it remains considerably below the 'baby boom' peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, [ 278 ] below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63. [ 277 ] In 2012, Scotland had the lowest TFR at only 1.67, followed by Wales at 1.88, England at 1.94, and Northern Ireland at 2.03. [ 277 ] In 2011, 47.3% of births in the UK were to unmarried women. [ 279 ] A government figure estimated that there are 3.6 million homosexual people in Britain comprising 6 per cent of the population. [ 280 ]

Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th century: the Celts , Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans . Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK. [ 285 ] A 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 per cent of England's gene pool contains Germanic Y chromosomes. [ 286 ] Another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that "about 75 per cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age", and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people . [ 287 ] [ 288 ] [ 289 ]
The UK has a history of small-scale non-white immigration, with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade, [ 290 ] and the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century. [ 291 ] In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas. [ 292 ]
Since 1948 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire . Migration from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups but, as of 2008 [update] , the trend is reversing. Many of these migrants are returning to their home countries, leaving the size of these groups unknown. [ 293 ] In 2011 [update] , 86% of the population identified themselves as White, meaning 12.9% of the UK population identify themselves as of mixed ethnic minority .
Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4% of London's population and 37.4% of Leicester 's was estimated to be non-white in 2005 [update] , [ 294 ] [ 295 ] whereas less than 5% of the populations of North East England , Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census. [ 296 ] In 2011 [update] , 26.5% of primary and 22.2% of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority. [ 297 ]
The non-white British population of England and Wales increased by 38% from 6.6 million in 2001 to 9.1 million in 2009. [ 298 ] The fastest-growing group was the mixed-ethnicity population, which doubled from 672,000 in 2001 to 986,600 in 2009. Also in the same period, a decrease of 36,000 white British people was recorded. [ 299 ]
The UK's de facto official language is English . [ 302 ] [ 303 ] It is estimated that 95% of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers. [ 304 ] 5.5% of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration. [ 304 ] South Asian languages, including Bengali , Tamil , Punjabi , Hindi and Gujarati , are the largest grouping and are spoken by 2.7% of the UK population. [ 304 ] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers. [ 305 ]
Four Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh ; Irish ; Scottish Gaelic ; and Cornish . All are recognised as regional or minority languages, subject to specific measures of protection and promotion under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages [ 2 ] [ 306 ] and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities . [ 307 ] In the 2001 Census over a fifth (21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, [ 308 ] an increase from the 1991 Census (18%). [ 309 ] In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England. [ 310 ] In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4%) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland ), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2% of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72% of those living in the Outer Hebrides . [ 311 ] The number of schoolchildren being taught through Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish is increasing. [ 312 ] Among emigrant-descended populations some Scottish Gaelic is still spoken in Canada (principally Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island ), [ 313 ] and Welsh in Patagonia , Argentina. [ 314 ]
Scots , a language descended from early northern Middle English , has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion. [ 2 ] [ 315 ]
It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England, [ 316 ] and up to age 16 in Scotland. French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland. All pupils in Wales are taught Welsh as a second language up to age 16, or are taught in Welsh . [ 317 ]
Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years. [ 318 ] Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, [ 319 ] while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam. [ 320 ] This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith, [ 321 ] secularised , [ 322 ] or post-Christian society. [ 323 ]
In the 2001 census 71.6% of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths (by number of adherents) being Islam (2.8%), Hinduism (1.0%), Sikhism (0.6%), Judaism (0.5%), Buddhism (0.3%) and all other religions (0.3%). [ 324 ] 15% of respondents stated that they had no religion , with a further 7% not stating a religious preference. [ 325 ] A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly. [ 326 ] Between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the amount of people who identified as Christian by 12%, whilst the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5%. [ 327 ]
The Church of England is the established church in England. [ 328 ] It retains a representation in the UK Parliament and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor . [ 329 ] In Scotland the Presbyterian Church of Scotland is recognised as the national church . It is not subject to state control , and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to "maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government" upon his or her accession. [ 330 ] [ 331 ] The (Anglican) Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, as the (Anglican) Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland , there is no established church in Northern Ireland. [ 332 ] Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62% of Christians are Anglican, 13.5% Catholic , 6% Presbyterian , 3.4% Methodist with small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as Open Brethren , and Orthodox churches. [ 333 ]
The United Kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration. The Great Famine in Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom, resulted in perhaps a million people migrating to Great Brtain. [ 334 ] Unable to return to Poland at the end of World War II, over 120,000 Polish veterans remained in the UK permanently. [ 335 ] After World War II, there was significant immigration from the colonies and newly independent former colonies, partly as a legacy of empire and partly driven by labour shortages. Many of these migrants came from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent . [ 336 ] The British Asian population has increased from 2.2 million in 2001 to over 4.2 million in 2011. [ 337 ]
One of the more recent trends in migration has been the arrival of workers from the new EU member states in Eastern Europe. In 2010, there were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the UK, corresponding to 11.3% of the total population. Of these, 4.76 million (7.7%) were born outside the EU and 2.24 million (3.6%) were born in another EU Member State. [ 338 ] The proportion of foreign-born people in the UK remains slightly below that of many other European countries. [ 339 ] However, immigration is now contributing to a rising population [ 340 ] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. Analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that a net total of 2.3 million migrants moved to the UK in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006. [ 341 ] [ 342 ] In 2008 it was predicted that migration would add 7 million to the UK population by 2031, [ 343 ] though these figures are disputed. [ 344 ] The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000. [ 345 ] In 2011 the net increase was 251,000: immigration was 589,000, while the number of people emigrating (for more than 12 months) was 338,000. [ 346 ] [ 347 ]
195,046 foreign nationals became British citizens in 2010, [ 348 ] compared to 54,902 in 1999. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] A record 241,192 people were granted permanent settlement rights in 2010, of whom 51 per cent were from Asia and 27 per cent from Africa. [ 350 ] 25.5 per cent of babies born in England and Wales in 2011 were born to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2012. [ 351 ]
Citizens of the European Union, including those of the UK, have the right to live and work in any EU member state. [ 352 ] The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007. [ 353 ] Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK of some 700,000 over that period. [ 354 ] [ 355 ] The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, [ 356 ] the migration becoming temporary and circular. [ 357 ] In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. [ 358 ] In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country. [ 346 ]
The UK government has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government's Fresh Talent Initiative . [ 359 ] In June 2010 the UK government introduced a temporary limit of 24,000 on immigration from outside the EU, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011. [ 360 ] The cap has caused tension within the coalition: business secretary Vince Cable has argued that it is harming British businesses. [ 361 ]
Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930 around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe. [ 362 ] Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad, [ 363 ] [ 364 ] [ 365 ] mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada. [ 363 ] [ 366 ]
Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system.
Whilst education in England is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education , the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local authorities . [ 367 ] Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944. [ 368 ] [ 369 ] Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August). In 2011, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science. [ 370 ] The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Two of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 were state-run grammar schools . Over half of students at the leading universities of Cambridge and Oxford had attended state schools. [ 371 ] Despite a fall in actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools has risen to over 7%. [ 372 ] In 2010, more than 45% of places at the University of Oxford and 40% at the University of Cambridge were taken by students from private schools, even though they educate just 7% of the population. [ 373 ] England has the two oldest universities in English-speaking world, Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (jointly known as " Oxbridge ") with history of over eight centuries. The United Kingdom has 9 universities featured in the Times Higher Education top 100 rankings, making it second to the United States in terms of representation. [ 374 ]
Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning , with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two non-departmental public bodies have key roles in Scottish education. The Scottish Qualifications Authority is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, post-secondary colleges of further education and other centres. [ 376 ] The Learning and Teaching Scotland provides advice, resources and staff development to education professionals. [ 377 ] Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496. [ 378 ] The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4%, and it has been rising slowly in recent years. [ 379 ] Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008. [ 380 ]
The Welsh Government has responsibility for education in Wales . A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the Welsh language ; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16. [ 381 ] There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh-medium schools as part of the policy of creating a fully bilingual Wales.
Education in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Minister of Education and the Minister for Employment and Learning , although responsibility at a local level is administered by five education and library boards covering different geographical areas. The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the government on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications. [ 382 ]
A government commission 's report in 2014 found that privately educated people comprise 7% of the general population of the UK but much larger percentages of the top professions, the most extreme case quoted being 71% of senior judges. [ 383 ] [ 384 ]
Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded health care , together with alternative , holistic and complementary treatments. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization , in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world. [ 385 ] [ 386 ]
Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council , the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges . However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives ; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive ; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government ; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government . Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts. [ 387 ] [ 388 ]
Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average. [ 389 ] The UK spends around 8.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and about one percentage point below the average of the European Union. [ 390 ]
The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the British Empire , British influence can be observed in the language , culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India , Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower." [ 391 ] [ 392 ]
'British literature' refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in the English language. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the largest publisher of books in the world. [ 393 ]
The English playwright and poet William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time, [ 394 ] [ 395 ] [ 396 ] and his contemporaries Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson have also been held in continuous high esteem. More recently the playwrights Alan Ayckbourn , Harold Pinter , Michael Frayn , Tom Stoppard and David Edgar have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.
Notable pre-modern and early-modern English writers include Geoffrey Chaucer (14th century), Thomas Malory (15th century), Sir Thomas More (16th century), John Bunyan (17th century) and John Milton (17th century). In the 18th century Daniel Defoe (author of Robinson Crusoe ) and Samuel Richardson were pioneers of the modern novel . In the 19th century there followed further innovation by Jane Austen , the gothic novelist Mary Shelley , the children's writer Lewis Carroll , the Brontë sisters , the social campaigner Charles Dickens , the naturalist Thomas Hardy , the realist George Eliot , the visionary poet William Blake and romantic poet William Wordsworth . 20th-century English writers include the science-fiction novelist H. G. Wells ; the writers of children's classics Rudyard Kipling , A. A. Milne (the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh ), Roald Dahl and Enid Blyton ; the controversial D. H. Lawrence ; the modernist Virginia Woolf ; the satirist Evelyn Waugh ; the prophetic novelist George Orwell ; the popular novelists W. Somerset Maugham and Graham Greene ; the crime writer Agatha Christie (the best-selling novelist of all time); [ 397 ] Ian Fleming (the creator of James Bond ); the poets T.S. Eliot , Philip Larkin and Ted Hughes ; the fantasy writers J. R. R. Tolkien , C. S. Lewis and J. K. Rowling ; the graphic novelist Alan Moore , whose novel Watchmen is often cited by critics as comic's greatest series and graphic novel [ 398 ] and one of the best-selling graphic novels ever published. [ 399 ]
Scotland's contributions include the detective writer Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes ), romantic literature by Sir Walter Scott , the children's writer J. M. Barrie , the epic adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson and the celebrated poet Robert Burns . More recently the modernist and nationalist Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance . A more grim outlook is found in Ian Rankin 's stories and the psychological horror-comedy of Iain Banks . Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, was UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature . [ 400 ]
Britain's oldest known poem, Y Gododdin , was composed in Yr Hen Ogledd ( The Old North ), most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur . [ 401 ] From around the seventh century, the connection between Wales and the Old North was lost, and the focus of Welsh-language culture shifted to Wales, where Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth . [ 402 ] Wales's most celebrated medieval poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym ( fl. 1320–1370), composed poetry on themes including nature, religion and especially love. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age. [ 403 ] Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character. Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are both Thomases. Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century. He is remembered for his poetry – his " Do not go gentle into that good night ; Rage, rage against the dying of the light." is one of the most quoted couplets of English language verse – and for his 'play for voices', Under Milk Wood . The influential Church in Wales 'poet-priest' and Welsh nationalist R. S. Thomas was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts . [ 404 ] [ 405 ]
Authors of other nationalities, particularly from Commonwealth countries, the Republic of Ireland and the United States, have lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include Jonathan Swift , Oscar Wilde , Bram Stoker , George Bernard Shaw , Joseph Conrad , T.S. Eliot , Ezra Pound and more recently British authors born abroad such as Kazuo Ishiguro and Sir Salman Rushdie . [ 406 ] [ 407 ]
Various styles of music are popular in the UK from the indigenous folk music of England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland to heavy metal . Notable composers of classical music from the United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it include William Byrd , Henry Purcell , Sir Edward Elgar , Gustav Holst , Sir Arthur Sullivan (most famous for working with the librettist Sir W. S. Gilbert ), Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten , pioneer of modern British opera. Sir Peter Maxwell Davies is one of the foremost living composers and current Master of the Queen's Music . The UK is also home to world-renowned symphonic orchestras and choruses such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus . Notable conductors include Sir Simon Rattle , John Barbirolli and Sir Malcolm Sargent . Some of the notable film score composers include John Barry , Clint Mansell , Mike Oldfield , John Powell , Craig Armstrong , David Arnold , John Murphy , Monty Norman and Harry Gregson-Williams . George Frideric Handel , although born German, was a naturalised British citizen [ 411 ] and some of his best works, such as Messiah , were written in the English language. [ 412 ] Andrew Lloyd Webber has achieved enormous worldwide commercial success and is a prolific composer of musical theatre, works which have dominated London's West End for a number of years and have travelled to Broadway in New York. [ 413 ]
The Beatles have international sales of over one billion units and are the biggest-selling and most influential band in the history of popular music. [ 408 ] [ 409 ] [ 410 ] [ 414 ] Other prominent British contributors to have influenced popular music over the last 50 years include; The Rolling Stones , Led Zeppelin , Pink Floyd , Queen , the Bee Gees , and Elton John , all of whom have world wide record sales of 200 million or more. [ 415 ] [ 416 ] [ 417 ] [ 418 ] [ 419 ] [ 420 ] The Brit Awards are the BPI 's annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include; The Who , David Bowie , Eric Clapton , Rod Stewart and The Police . [ 421 ] More recent UK music acts that have had international success include Coldplay , Radiohead , Oasis , Spice Girls , Robbie Williams , Amy Winehouse and Adele . [ 422 ]
A number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had more UK chart number one hit singles per capita (54) than any other city worldwide. [ 423 ] Glasgow 's contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it was named a UNESCO City of Music , one of only three cities in the world to have this honour. [ 424 ]
The history of British visual art forms part of western art history . Major British artists include: the Romantics William Blake , John Constable , Samuel Palmer and J.M.W. Turner ; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud ; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L. S. Lowry ; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris ; the figurative painter Francis Bacon ; the Pop artists Peter Blake , Richard Hamilton and David Hockney ; the collaborative duo Gilbert and George ; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin ; and the sculptors Antony Gormley , Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore . During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the " Young British Artists ": Damien Hirst , Chris Ofili , Rachel Whiteread , Tracey Emin , Mark Wallinger , Steve McQueen , Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.
The Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school University of the Arts London , which includes the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and Design ; Goldsmiths, University of London ; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of University College London ); the Glasgow School of Art ; the Royal College of Art ; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of the history of art . Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the National Gallery , National Portrait Gallery , Tate Britain and Tate Modern (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7 million visitors per year). [ 425 ]
The United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock , whose film Vertigo is considered by some critics as the best film of all time , [ 426 ] and David Lean are among the most critically acclaimed of all-time. [ 427 ] Other important directors including Charlie Chaplin , [ 428 ] Michael Powell , [ 429 ] Carol Reed [ 430 ] and Ridley Scott . [ 431 ] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: Julie Andrews , [ 432 ] Richard Burton , [ 433 ] Michael Caine , [ 434 ] Charlie Chaplin, [ 435 ] Sean Connery , [ 436 ] Vivien Leigh , [ 437 ] David Niven , [ 438 ] Laurence Olivier , [ 439 ] Peter Sellers , [ 440 ] Kate Winslet , [ 441 ] and Daniel Day-Lewis , the only person to win an Oscar in the best actor category three times. [ 442 ] Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including the two highest-grossing film franchises ( Harry Potter and James Bond ). [ 443 ] Ealing Studios has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world. [ 444 ]
Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of American and European influence. British producers are active in international co-productions and British actors, directors and crew feature regularly in American films. Many successful Hollywood films have been based on British people, stories or events, including Titanic , The Lord of the Rings , Pirates of the Caribbean .
In 2009, British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom. [ 445 ] UK box-office takings totalled £944 million in 2009, with around 173 million admissions. [ 445 ] The British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking of what it considers to be the 100 greatest British films of all time, the BFI Top 100 British films . [ 446 ] The annual British Academy Film Awards , hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts , are the British equivalent of the Oscars . [ 447 ]
The BBC , founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. [ 448 ] [ 449 ] [ 450 ] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence . [ 451 ] [ 452 ] Other major players in the UK media include ITV plc , which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network , [ 453 ] and News Corporation , which owns a number of national newspapers through News International such as the most popular tabloid The Sun and the longest-established daily " broadsheet " The Times , [ 454 ] as well as holding a large stake in satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting . [ 455 ] London dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales respectively. [ 456 ] The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people. [ 457 ]
In 2009, it was estimated that individuals viewed a mean of 3.75 hours of television per day and 2.81 hours of radio. In that year the main BBC public service broadcasting channels accounted for an estimated 28.4% of all television viewing; the three main independent channels accounted for 29.5% and the increasingly important other satellite and digital channels for the remaining 42.1%. [ 458 ] Sales of newspapers have fallen since the 1970s and in 2009 42% of people reported reading a daily national newspaper. [ 459 ] In 2010 82.5% of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year. [ 460 ]
The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the ' Scottish School of Common Sense '. [ 461 ] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke , George Berkeley and David Hume ; while Dugald Stewart , Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish "common sense" school. Two Britons are also notable for a theory of moral philosophy utilitarianism , first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism . [ 462 ] [ 463 ] Other eminent philosophers from the UK and the unions and countries that preceded it include Duns Scotus , John Lilburne , Mary Wollstonecraft , Sir Francis Bacon , Adam Smith , Thomas Hobbes , William of Ockham , Bertrand Russell and A.J. "Freddie" Ayer . Foreign-born philosophers who settled in the UK include Isaiah Berlin , Karl Marx , Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein .
Major sports, including association football , tennis , rugby union , rugby league , golf , boxing , rowing and cricket , originated or were substantially developed in the UK and the states that preceded it. With the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th-century Victorian Britain , in 2012, the President of the IOC, Jacques Rogge , stated; "This great, sports-loving country is widely recognized as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum". [ 465 ] [ 466 ]
In most international competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing all of Ireland, with notable exceptions being association football and the Commonwealth Games . In sporting contexts, the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish / Northern Irish teams are often referred to collectively as the Home Nations . There are some sports in which a single team represents the whole of United Kingdom, including the Olympics, where the UK is represented by the Great Britain team . The 1908 , 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics were held in London, making it the first city to host the games three times. Britain has participated in every modern Olympic Games to date and is third in the medal count .
A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom . [ 467 ] Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and league system . The English top division, the Premier League , is the most watched football league in the world. [ 468 ] The first-ever international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30 November 1872. [ 469 ] England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland compete as separate countries in international competitions. [ 470 ] A Great Britain Olympic football team was assembled for the first time to compete in the London 2012 Olympic Games . However, the Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish football associations declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status – a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter. [ 471 ]
Cricket was invented in England. The England cricket team , controlled by the England and Wales Cricket Board , [ 472 ] is the only national team in the UK with Test status . Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from football and rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had fielded its own team in the past. Irish and Scottish players have played for England because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and have only recently started to play in One Day Internationals . [ 473 ] [ 474 ] Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the Cricket World Cup , with England reaching the finals on three occasions. There is a professional league championship in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete. [ 475 ]
Rugby league is a popular sport in some regions of the UK. It originated in Huddersfield and is generally played in Northern England . [ 476 ] A single 'Great Britain Lions' team had competed in the Rugby League World Cup and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when England , Scotland and Ireland competed as separate nations. [ 477 ] Great Britain is still being retained as the full national team for Ashes tours against Australia, New Zealand and France. Super League is the highest level of professional rugby league in the UK and Europe. It consists of 11 teams from Northern England, 1 from London, 1 from Wales and 1 from France.
In rugby union , England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship ; the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sport governing bodies in England , Scotland , Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately. [ 478 ] If any of the British teams or the Irish team beat the other three in a tournament, then it is awarded the Triple Crown . [ 479 ]
Thoroughbred racing , which originated under Charles II of England as the "sport of kings", is popular throughout the UK with world-famous races including the Grand National , the Epsom Derby , Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival (including the Cheltenham Gold Cup ). The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in rowing .
The UK is closely associated with motorsport . Many teams and drivers in Formula One (F1) are based in the UK, and the country has won more drivers' and constructors' titles than any other. The UK hosted the very first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at Silverstone , the current location of the British Grand Prix held each year in July. The country also hosts legs of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing , World Rally Championship and FIA World Endurance Championship . The premier national auto racing event is the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC). Motorcycle road racing has a long tradition with races such as the Isle of Man TT and the North West 200 .
Golf is the sixth-most popular sport, by participation, in the UK. Although The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland is the sport's home course, [ 480 ] the world's oldest golf course is actually Musselburgh Links' Old Golf Course. [ 481 ]
Snooker is one of the UK's popular sporting exports, with the world championships held annually in Sheffield . [ 482 ] The modern game of lawn tennis first originated in the city of Birmingham between 1859 and 1865. [ 483 ] The Championships, Wimbledon are international tennis events held in Wimbledon in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar. In Northern Ireland Gaelic football and hurling are popular team sports, both in terms of participation and spectating, and Irish expatriates in the UK and the US also play them. [ 484 ] Shinty (or camanachd ) is popular in the Scottish Highlands . [ 485 ]
The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack). It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the Flag of England on the Flag of Scotland and updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag . Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out. [ 486 ] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is " God Save the King ", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.
Britannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain . [ 487 ] Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a Corinthian helmet and white robes. She holds Poseidon 's three-pronged trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding on the back of a lion. Since the height of the British Empire in the late 19th century, Britannia has often been associated with British maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song " Rule, Britannia! ". Up until 2008, the lion symbol was depicted behind Britannia on the British fifty pence coin and on the back of the British ten pence coin . It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the British Army. The bulldog is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of Nazi Germany. [ 488 ]

Water is a transparent fluid which forms the world's streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of living things. As a chemical compound , a water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds . Water is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure , but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice ; and gaseous state, steam ( water vapor ).
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. [ 1 ] It is vital for all known forms of life . On Earth, 96.5% of the planet's water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in the air as vapor , clouds (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and precipitation . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is freshwater , and 98.8% of that water is in ice and groundwater . Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. [ 2 ]
Water on Earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration ( evapotranspiration ), condensation , precipitation , and runoff , usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Water used in the production of a good or service is known as virtual water .
Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients . Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation . [ 4 ] There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita . [ 5 ] However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability. [ 6 ] A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%. [ 7 ] Water plays an important role in the world economy , as it functions as a solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances and facilitates industrial cooling and transportation. Approximately 70% of the fresh water used by humans goes to agriculture . [ 8 ]


Water is the chemical substance with chemical formula H 2 O : one molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to a single oxygen atom.
Water appears in nature in all three common states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) and may take many different forms on Earth: water vapor and clouds in the sky, seawater in the oceans, icebergs in the polar oceans, glaciers in the mountains , fresh and salt water lakes , rivers , and aquifers in the ground.
The major chemical and physical properties of water are:
Pure H 2 O is tasteless and odorless.
Water can dissolve many different substances, giving it varying tastes and odors. Humans , and other animals, have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid .
The taste of spring water and mineral water , often advertised in marketing of consumer products, derives from the minerals dissolved in it. The advertised purity of spring and mineral water refers to absence of toxins , pollutants , and microbes , not to the absence of naturally occurring minerals.
Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of star formation . When stars are born, their birth is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas. [ 15 ]
On 22 July 2011 a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing "140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined" around a quasar located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the "discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence". [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
Water has been detected in interstellar clouds within our galaxy , the Milky Way . [ citation needed ] Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too, because its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. [ citation needed ] Based on models of the formation and evolution of the Solar System and that of other star systems, most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients.
Water is present as vapor in:
Liquid water is known to be present on Earth, covering 71% of our planet's surface. Scientists believe liquid water is present in the Saturnian moons of Enceladus , as a 10 kilometre thick ocean approximately 30-40 kilometres below Enceladus' south polar surface, [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and Titan , as a subsurface layer, possibly mixed with ammonia. [ 38 ] Liquid water may also exist on Jupiter's moon Ganymede as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock. [ 39 ]
Water is present as ice on:
And may also be present on:
Water and other volatiles probably comprise much of the internal structures of Uranus and Neptune and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of ionic water in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down as superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. [ 44 ]
The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of life on Earth as we know it. The Earth is located in the habitable zone of the solar system ; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the Sun (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]
Earth's gravity allows it to hold an atmosphere . Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer ( greenhouse effect ) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars ).
The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation ( insolation ), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo . This proposal is known as the Gaia hypothesis .
The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets Gliese 436 b [ 47 ] and GJ 1214 b . [ 48 ]
Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is hydrography . The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology , of glaciers is glaciology , of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography . Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of ecohydrology .
The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the hydrosphere . Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1,338,000,000 km 3 (321,000,000 mi 3 ). [ 2 ]
Liquid water is found in bodies of water , such as an ocean, sea , lake , river , stream , canal , pond , or puddle . The majority of water on Earth is sea water . Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in aquifers .
Water is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most rocks , and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of faulting . Water in the mantle is responsible for the melt that produces volcanoes at subduction zones . On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical weathering processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of sediment transport that occurs on the surface of the earth. Deposition of transported sediment forms many types of sedimentary rocks , which make up the geologic record of Earth history .
The water cycle (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle ) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the hydrosphere , between the atmosphere , soil water, surface water , groundwater , and plants .
Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the water cycle consisting of following transfer processes:
Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47 Tt per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72 Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain , snow , and hail , with some contribution from fog and dew . [ 49 ] Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase. [ 50 ] Condensed water in the air may also refract sunlight to produce rainbows .
Water runoff often collects over watersheds flowing into rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model . Some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce . Through erosion , runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.
Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes. At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow pack and glaciers. Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in springs , or more spectacularly in hot springs and geysers . Groundwater is also extracted artificially in wells . This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.
Sea water contains about 3.5% salt on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9 °C) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the Baltic Sea to 4.0% in the Red Sea .
Tides are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and estuarine water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the effects of Earth rotation and the local bathymetry . The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the intertidal zone , is an important ecological product of ocean tides.
From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication . All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.
Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO 2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO 2 in the process (cellular respiration).
Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H + , that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH − ) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7.
Earth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales . Some kinds of animals, such as amphibians , spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton is generally the foundation of the ocean food chain .
Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have gills instead of lungs , although some species of fish, such as the lungfish , have both. Marine mammals , such as dolphins, whales, otters , and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see insect and mollusc siphons ) and gills ( Carcinus ). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water.
Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; Mesopotamia , the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers Tigris and Euphrates ; the ancient society of the Egyptians depended entirely upon the Nile . Large metropolises like Rotterdam , London , Montreal , Paris , New York City , Buenos Aires , Shanghai , Tokyo , Chicago , and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore , have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East , where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.
Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or potable water . Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or distillation , or by a range of other methods .
Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called safe water , or "safe for bathing". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light.
In the USA, non-potable forms of wastewater generated by humans may be referred to as greywater , which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and blackwater , which generally contains sewage and other forms of waste which require further treatment in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ( sinks , showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets , which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.
This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and sanitation during the 2003 G8 Evian summit . [ 51 ] Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water. The World Health Organization estimates that safe water could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhea each year. [ 52 ]
Water, however, is not a finite resource, but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many degrees of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking water supply , which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a non-renewable resource , and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.
In the developing world, 90% of all wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams. [ 53 ] Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles. [ 54 ] The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.
The most important use of water in agriculture is for irrigation , which is a key component to produce enough food. Irrigation takes up to 90% of water withdrawn in some developing countries [ 55 ] and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (United States, 30% of freshwater usage is for irrigation). [ 56 ]
Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At this time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of peak water . [ 57 ] This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry , urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050. [ 58 ]
An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population. [ 59 ] It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity , where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity , where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently. [ 60 ]
On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice." [ 61 ] For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram . Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0 °C — a highly reproducible temperature — the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water density , which was measured at the time as 4 °C (39 °F). [ 62 ]
The Kelvin temperature scale of the SI system is based on the triple point of water, defined as exactly 273.16 K or 0.01 °C. The scale is an absolute temperature scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according the boiling point (set to 100 °C) and melting point (set to 0 °C) of water.
Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 ( deuterium ). The amount of deuterium oxides or heavy water is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water specification.
The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. [ 63 ] To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration ; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. [ 64 ] Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather. [ 65 ]
For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] The popular claim that "a person should consume eight glasses of water per day" seems to have no real basis in science. [ 68 ] Similar misconceptions concerning the effect of water on weight loss and constipation have also been dispelled. [ 69 ]
An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the United States National Research Council read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods." [ 70 ] The latest dietary reference intake report by the United States National Research Council in general recommended (including food sources): 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters of water total for women. [ 71 ]
Specifically, pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The Institute of Medicine (U.S.) recommends that, on average, men consume 3.0 liters and women 2.2 liters; pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (10 cups) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing. [ 72 ] Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages ( caffeinated included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through urine and feces , through sweating , and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.
Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead, [ 73 ] and/or harmful bacteria , such as Vibrio . Some solutes are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed electrolytes . [ 74 ]
The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is Lake Baikal in Siberia. [ 75 ]
The propensity of water to form solutions and emulsions is useful in various washing processes. Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances. Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal body hygiene .
The use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant and less commonly as a solute or catalyst . In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is amphoteric (acidic and basic) and nucleophilic . Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions by water has been observed. Supercritical water has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently.
Water and steam are a common fluid used for heat exchange , due to its availability and high heat capacity , both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization . A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all thermal power stations , water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower ). In the United States , cooling power plants is the largest use of water. [ 56 ]
In the nuclear power industry, water can also be used as a neutron moderator . In most nuclear reactors , water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also slows the nuclear reaction down . However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.
Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.
Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a steam explosion , which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal , charcoal , or coke graphite, decompose the water, producing water gas .
The power of such explosions was seen in the Chernobyl disaster , although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot zirconium .
Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming , waterskiing , boating , surfing and diving . In addition, some sports, like ice hockey and ice skating , are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in aquariums or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. skiing , sledding , snowmobiling or snowboarding , which require the water to be frozen.
The water industry provides drinking water and wastewater services (including sewage treatment ) to households and industry . Water supply facilities include water wells , cisterns for rainwater harvesting , water supply networks , and water purification facilities, water tanks , water towers , water pipes including old aqueducts . Atmospheric water generators are in development.
Drinking water is often collected at springs , extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes . Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes. Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis . Desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates .
The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems , tanker delivery or as bottled water . Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.
Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong , sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources .
Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable .
Wastewater facilities are storm sewers and wastewater treatment plants . Another way to remove pollution from surface runoff water is bioswale .
Water is used in power generation . Hydroelectricity is electricity obtained from hydropower . Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.
Pressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters . Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.
Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the steam turbine and heat exchanger , in addition to its use as a chemical solvent . Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution . Pollution includes discharged solutes ( chemical pollution ) and discharged coolant water (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.
Boiling , steaming , and simmering are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam. Water is also used for dishwashing . Water also plays many critical roles within the field of food science . It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products. [ citation needed ]
Solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as air pressure , which is in turn is affected by altitude . Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One mole of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 °C (32.918 °F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 °C (33.836 °F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point. [ 76 ]
Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food. [ 77 ] Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water. [ 76 ] Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity. [ 77 ] Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.
Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on the amounts of removable calcium carbonate salt the water contains per gallon. Water hardness is measured in grains: 0.064 g calcium carbonate is equivalent to one grain of hardness. [ 76 ] Water is classified as soft if it contains 1 to 4 grains, medium if it contains 5 to 10 grains and hard if it contains 11 to 20 grains. [ vague ] [ 76 ]
The hardness of water also affects its pH balance, which plays a critical role in food processing. For example, hard water prevents successful production of clear beverages. Water hardness also affects sanitation; with increasing hardness, there is a loss of effectiveness for its use as a sanitizer. [ 76 ]
According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production. [ 78 ]
Water politics is politics affected by water and water resources . For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts. It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.
1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990. [ 79 ] The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30% in 1970 [ 80 ] to 71% in 1990, 79% in 2000 and 84% in 2004. This trend is projected to continue. [ 4 ] To halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water is one of the Millennium Development Goals . This goal is projected to be reached.
A 2006 United Nations report stated that "there is enough water for everyone", but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption. [ 81 ] In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act. [ 82 ]
The authors of the 2007 Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the International Water Management Institute of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be. [ 83 ]
The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from the World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal hygiene . More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from waterborne diseases (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought . In 2004, the UK charity WaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of sewage disposal; see toilet .
Organizations concerned with water protection include the International Water Association (IWA), WaterAid , Water 1st , and the American Water Resources Association. The International Water Management Institute undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships , United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Ramsar Convention . World Day for Water takes place on 22 March and World Ocean Day on 8 June.
Water is considered a purifier in most religions. Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ( ablution ) include Christianity , Hinduism , Islam , Judaism , the Rastafari movement , Shinto , Taoism , and Wicca . Immersion (or aspersion or affusion ) of a person in water is a central sacrament of Christianity (where it is called baptism ); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam ( Ghusl ), Judaism ( mikvah ) and Sikhism ( Amrit Sanskar ). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water ( wudu ), unless water is unavailable (see Tayammum ). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of misogi ).
The Ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles held that water is one of the four classical elements along with fire , earth and air , and was regarded as the ylem , or basic substance of the universe. Thales , who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from water. Thales, a monist , believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an icosahedron which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube shaped earth. [ 84 ]
In the theory of the four bodily humors , water was associated with phlegm , as being cold and moist. The classical element of water was also one of the five elements in traditional Chinese philosophy , along with earth , fire , wood , and metal .
Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge's 1891 translation of the Dao De Jing states "The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao" and "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed." [ 85 ] Guanzi in "Shui di" 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water, proclaiming that "man is water" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources. [ 86 ]
Water is described in many terms and contexts:

The lion ( Panthera leo ) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae . With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, [ 4 ] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger . Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene , about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans . They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru . [ 5 ] The lion is a vulnerable species , having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30–50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century. [ 2 ] Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
Lions live for 10–14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity. [ 6 ] They typically inhabit savanna and grassland , although they may take to bush and forest . Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates . Lions are apex and keystone predators , although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are primarily nocturnal , although bordering on crepuscular in nature. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture . Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves , through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire , and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies .


The lion's name, similar in many Romance languages , is derived from the Latin leo , [ 9 ] and the Ancient Greek λέων ( leon ). [ 10 ] The Hebrew word לָבִיא ( lavi ) may also be related. [ 11 ] It was one of the species originally described by Linnaeus , who gave it the name Felis leo , in his eighteenth-century work, Systema Naturae . [ 3 ]
The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus Panthera : the tiger , the jaguar , and the leopard . P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region. [ 12 ] It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700,000 years ago with the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion ( Panthera leo spelaea ), [ 13 ] which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia at the end of the last glaciation , about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Traditionally, 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognised, distinguished by mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics. [ 16 ] Today, only eight subspecies are usually accepted, [ 15 ] [ 17 ] although one of these, the Cape lion , formerly described as Panthera leo melanochaita , is probably invalid. [ 17 ] Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many. While the status of the Asiatic lion ( P. l. persica ) as a subspecies is generally accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies, therefore all sub-Saharan lions sometimes have been considered a single subspecies, however, a recent study revealed lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, Western African lions are more closely related to Asian lions than to South or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa and a subsequent recolonization of these parts from Asia. [ 18 ] Previous studies, which were focused mainly on lions from eastern and southern parts of Africa, already showed these can be possibly divided in two main clades : one to the west of the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east. Lions from Tsavo in eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in Transvaal (South Africa), than to those in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya. [ 19 ] Another study revealed there are three major types of lions, one North African–Asian, one southern African and one middle African. [ 20 ] Conversely, Per Christiansen found that using skull morphology allowed him to identify the subspecies krugeri , nubica , persica , and senegalensis , while there was overlap between bleyenberghi with senegalensis and krugeri . The Asiatic lion persica was the most distinctive, and the Cape lion had characteristics allying it more with P. l. persica than the other sub-Saharan lions. He had analysed 58 lion skulls in three European museums. [ 21 ]
The majority of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes which are extinct in the wild, and might be therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion. [ 17 ] It is believed that those lions, imported to Europe before the middle of the nineteenth century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape. [ 22 ]
Eight recent ( Holocene ) subspecies are recognised today:
Several additional subspecies of lion existed in prehistoric times:
Lions have been known to breed with tigers (most often the Siberian and Bengal subspecies) to create hybrids called ligers and tiglons (or tigons). [ 42 ] They also have been crossed with leopards to produce leopons , [ 43 ] and jaguars to produce jaglions . The marozi is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the Congolese spotted lion is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called a lijagulep. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.
The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. [ 44 ] Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow them, their manes will be modest: around 50% the size of a pure lion mane.
Ligers are much bigger than normal lions, typically 3.65 m (12.0 ft) in length, and can weigh up to 500 kg (1,100 lb). [ 45 ]
The less common tiglon or tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger. [ 46 ] In contrast to ligers, tigons are often relatively small in comparison to their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects. [ 45 ]
Behind only the tiger, the lion is the second largest living felid in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger, however, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. [ 47 ] Lion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.
Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism – that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older. The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5 mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail – the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5½ months of age and is readily identifiable at 7 months. [ 48 ]
The size of adult lions varies across their range with those from the southern African populations in Rhodesia, Kalahari and Kruger Park averaging around 189.6 kg (418 lb) and 126.9 kg (280 lb) in males and females respectively compared to 174.9 kg (386 lb) and 119.5 kg (263 lb) of male and female lions from East Africa . [ 49 ] Reported body measurements in males are head-body lengths ranging from 170 to 250 cm (5 ft 7 in to 8 ft 2 in), tail lengths of 90–105 cm (2 ft 11 in–3 ft 5 in). In females reported head-body lengths range from 140 to 175 cm (4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 9 in), tail lengths of 70–100 cm (2 ft 4 in–3 ft 3 in), [ 4 ] however, the frequently cited maximum head and body length of 250 cm (8 ft 2 in) fits rather to extinct Pleistocene forms, like the American lion , with even large modern lions measuring several centimetres less in length. [ 50 ] Record measurements from hunting records are supposedly a total length of nearly 3.6 m (12 ft) for a male shot near Mucsso, southern Angola in October 1973 and a weight of 313 kg (690 lb) for a male shot outside Hectorspruit in eastern Transvaal , South Africa in 1936. [ 51 ] Another notably outsized male lion, which was shot near Mount Kenya , weighed in at 272 kg (600 lb). [ 25 ]
The mane of the adult male lion, unique among cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It may provide an excellent intimidation display; aiding the lion during confrontations with other lions. [ 52 ] The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the rule of thumb is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favors males with the densest, darkest mane. [ 53 ] Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year. [ 54 ]
Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology , including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion . Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the colour and size of a lion's mane, such as the ambient temperature . [ 54 ] The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos , for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. [ 17 ] [ 55 ] The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions. [ 56 ]
In the Pendjari National Park area almost all males are maneless or have very weak manes. [ 57 ] Maneless male lions have also been reported from Senegal , from Sudan ( Dinder National Park ), and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The testosterone hormone has been linked to mane growth, therefore castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. [ 58 ]
Cave paintings of extinct European cave lions almost exclusively show animals with no manes, suggesting that either they were maneless, [ 36 ] or that the paintings depict lionesses as seen hunting in a group.
The white lion is not a distinct subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism , [ 16 ] that causes paler colouration akin to that of the white tiger ; the condition is similar to melanism , which causes black panthers . They are not albinos, having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White Transvaal lion ( Panthera leo krugeri ) individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity , where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is due to a recessive allele . [ 59 ] Reportedly, they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts . [ 60 ]
Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20 hours per day. [ 61 ] Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating. [ 62 ]
Lions are the most socially inclined of all wild felids , most of which remain quite solitary in nature. The lion is a predatory carnivore with two types of social organization. Some lions are residents, living in groups centering around related lionesses, called prides . [ 63 ] Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females; [ 64 ] membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, [ 65 ] although some females do leave and become nomadic. [ 66 ] The pride usually consists of five or six females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males (known as a coalition if more than one) who mate with the adult females (although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed). The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two but may increase to as many as four and decrease again over time, [ 66 ] while a Tsavo lion pride always has one adult male only. [ 67 ] Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. [ 66 ] The second organizational behaviour is labeled nomads , who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. [ 63 ] Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males, as a rule, live at least some portion of their lives as nomads, and some are never able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related, and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group.
The area a pride occupies is called a pride area , whereas that by a nomad is a range . [ 63 ] The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory . Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger. [ 25 ]
Lionesses do most of the hunting for their pride. They are more effective hunters, as they are smaller, swifter, and more agile than the males and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a coordinated group with members who perform the same role consistently in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing of larger kills, [ 68 ] although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as each tries to consume as much food as possible. Near the conclusion of the hunt, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded. They are more likely to share this with the cubs than with the lionesses, but males rarely share food they have killed by themselves.
Both males and females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. [ 69 ] Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. [ 70 ] Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. [ 71 ] An alternative hypothesis is that there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. [ 72 ] The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.
Lions prefer to scavenge when the opportunity presents itself, [ 73 ] and scavenged food provides more than 50% of their diets. [ 74 ] They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress. [ 73 ] In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions. [ 4 ]
The lioness is the one that does most of the hunting for the pride. The male lion associated with the pride usually stays and watches its young while waiting for the lionesses to return from the hunt. Typically, several lionesses work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is killed by strangulation , [ 75 ] which can cause cerebral ischemia or asphyxia (which results in hypoxemic , or "general", hypoxia ). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia). [ 4 ]
Lions usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina – for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57% of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1% of its body weight. [ 76 ] Thus, they only run fast in short bursts, [ 77 ] and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night. [ 78 ] They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30 metres (98 feet) or less.
The prey consists mainly of medium-sized mammals, with a preference for wildebeest , zebras , buffalo , and warthogs in Africa and nilgai , wild boar , and several deer species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability. Mainly this will include ungulates weighing between 50 and 300 kg (110 and 660 lb) such as kudu , hartebeest , gemsbok , and eland . [ 4 ] Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as Thomson's gazelle or springbok . Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male giraffes due to the danger of injury. Giraffes and buffaloes are almost invulnerable to a solitary lion as well. [ 79 ]
Extensive studies show that lionesses normally prey on mammals with an average weight of 126 kg (278 lb), while kills made by male lions average 399 kg (880 lb). [ 80 ] In Africa, wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey (making nearly half of the lion prey in the Serengeti ) followed by zebra. [ 81 ] Lions do not prey on fully grown adult elephants ; most adult hippopotamuses , rhinoceroses , and smaller gazelles , impala , and other agile antelopes are generally excluded. However, giraffes and buffaloes are often taken in certain regions. For instance, in Kruger National Park, giraffes are regularly hunted. [ 82 ] In Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet, [ 83 ] due to the high number density of buffaloes. Occasionally hippopotamus is also taken, but adult rhinoceroses are generally avoided. Warthogs are often taken depending on availability. [ 84 ] The lions of Savuti , Botswana, have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. [ 85 ] In the Kalahari desert in South Africa , black-maned lions may chase baboons up a tree, wait patiently, then attack them when they try to escape:
Lions also attack domestic livestock; in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. [ 56 ] Lions are capable of killing other predators such as leopards , cheetahs , hyenas , and wild dogs , though (unlike most felids) they seldom devour the competitors after killing them. A lion may gorge itself and eat up to 30 kg (66 lb) in one sitting; [ 86 ] if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more. On a hot day, the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard. [ 87 ] An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day, a male about 7 kg (15 lb). [ 88 ]
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses. [ 89 ] There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush. [ 90 ] Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two. [ 91 ]
Lions and spotted hyenas occupy the same ecological niche (and hence compete) where they coexist. A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. [ 92 ] Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, whether there is food or not. Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas: in the Ngorongoro crater , it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. [ 93 ] On the other hand, in Northern Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed: hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills: they obtain food from 63% of all lion kills. [ 94 ] When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 m (98–328 ft) until the lions have finished, [ 95 ] but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions, and even force the lions off a kill. The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha . Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories. [ 98 ] Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent. [ 93 ] The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions.
Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. [ 99 ] Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, up to 90% of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush. Leopards also use such tactics, but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills. [ 100 ] Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs , not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. [ 101 ] However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. [ 82 ] [ 102 ]
The Nile crocodile is the only sympatric predator (besides humans) that can singly threaten the lion. Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, [ 103 ] while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs. [ 104 ]
While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; one well-publicised case includes the Tsavo maneaters , where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. [ 105 ] The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans. [ 106 ]
In their analysis of Tsavo and general man-eating, Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating, but that the behaviour is "not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. The authors note that the relationship is well-attested amongst other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record. [ 107 ]
The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period – a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages. [ 108 ] Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon (when there was less moonlight) were a strong indicator of increased night attacks on people. [ 109 ]
Author Robert R. Frump wrote in The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm. [ 110 ]
Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, crocodiles , elephants, hippos, and snakes , and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation. [ 108 ]
A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35 people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region. [ 111 ] Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess underneath a molar which was cracked in several places. He further commented that "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing." [ 112 ] GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.
The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but incidents in the early 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then Tanganyika (now Tanzania). George Rushby , game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in what is now Njombe district. [ 113 ]
Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age. [ 114 ] Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous . [ 115 ] As with other cats' penises , the male lion's penis has spines that point backward . During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina , which may cause ovulation. [ 116 ] A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat ; [ 117 ] during a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple copulates twenty to forty times a day, often forgoing eating. Lions reproduce very well in captivity.
The average gestation period is around 110 days, [ 115 ] the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept. [ 118 ] The cubs themselves are born blind – their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. [ 119 ] The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs. [ 118 ]
Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. [ 118 ] Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes – consequently, death by starvation is more common amongst the younger cubs.
In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles, and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede toward the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death while warding off the lioness. Furthermore, when one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any existing young cubs, [ 120 ] perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. All in all, as many as 80% of the cubs will die before the age of two. [ 121 ]
1 of 4: A tolerant black- maned male
When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing amongst themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away. [ 122 ]
Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4–5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest, [ 123 ] if they have not already been critically injured while defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male. [ 120 ]
Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted. [ 124 ] Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members.
One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact homosexually . Lions are shown to involved in group homosexual and courtship activities. Male Lions will also head rub and roll around with each other before having sex together. [ 125 ]
Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. [ 126 ] Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill. [ 127 ] Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey. [ 128 ]
Various species of tick commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of most lions. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Adult forms of several species of the tapeworm genus Taenia have been isolated from intestines, the lions having ingested larval forms from antelope meat. [ 131 ] Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly ( Stomoxys calcitrans ) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming covered in bloody bare patches and emaciated. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many perished or emigrated as the population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. [ 132 ] A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions. [ 133 ] Lions, especially in captivity, are vulnerable to the canine distemper virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). [ 16 ] CDV is spread through domestic dogs and other carnivores ; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis . [ 134 ] FIV, which is similar to HIV while not known to adversely affect lions, is worrisome enough in its effect in domestic cats that the Species Survival Plan recommends systematic testing in captive lions. It occurs with high to endemic frequency in several wild lion populations, but is mostly absent from Asiatic and Namibian lions. [ 16 ]
When resting, lion socialization occurs through a number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking , [ 135 ] which have been compared with grooming in primates. [ 136 ] Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, [ 137 ] as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. [ 138 ] Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually. [ 139 ]
Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures. [ 140 ] Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing, and roaring. Lions tend to roar in a very characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off into a series of shorter ones. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] They most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of 8 kilometres (5.0 mi), is used to advertise the animal's presence. [ 143 ] Lions have the loudest roar of any big cat.
In Africa, lions can be found in savanna grasslands with scattered Acacia trees which serve as shade; [ 145 ] their habitat in India is a mixture of dry savanna forest and very dry deciduous scrub forest. [ 146 ] The habitat of lions originally spanned the southern parts of Eurasia , ranging from Greece to India, and most of Africa except the central rainforest -zone and the Sahara desert. Herodotus reported that lions had been common in Greece in 480 BC; they attacked the baggage camels of the Persian king Xerxes on his march through the country. Aristotle considered them rare by 300 BC. By 100 AD they were extirpated. [ 147 ] A population of Asiatic lions survived until the tenth century in the Caucasus , their last European outpost. [ 148 ]
The species was eradicated from Palestine by the Middle Ages and from most of the rest of Asia after the arrival of readily available firearms in the eighteenth century. Between the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, they became extinct in North Africa and Southwest Asia . By the late nineteenth century, the lion had disappeared from Turkey and most of northern India, [ 16 ] [ 149 ] while the last sighting of a live Asiatic lion in Iran was in 1941 (between Shiraz and Jahrom, Fars Province ), although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river, Khūzestān Province in 1944. There are no subsequent reliable reports from Iran . [ 86 ] The subspecies now survives only in and around the Gir Forest of northwestern India. [ 23 ] Approximately 400 lions live in the area of the 1,412 km 2 (545 sq mi) sanctuary in the state of Gujarat , which covers most of the forest. Their numbers have increased from 180 to 411 animals mainly because the natural prey species have recovered. [ 24 ] [ 150 ]
Most lions now live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30–50% decline per 20 years in the late half of the 20th century. [ 2 ] Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004, [ 152 ] [ 153 ] down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. [ 2 ] Habitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered the most significant threats to the species. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] The remaining populations are often geographically isolated from one another, which can lead to inbreeding , and consequently, reduced genetic diversity . Therefore the lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , while the Asiatic subspecies is endangered . [ 156 ] The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from lion populations of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850–1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in Burkina Faso 's Arly-Singou ecosystem. [ 2 ] Another population in northwestern Africa is found in Waza National Park , where approximately 14–21 animals persist. [ 157 ]
Conservation of both African and Asian lions has required the setup and maintenance of national parks and game reserves; among the best known are Etosha National Park in Namibia , Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and Kruger National Park in eastern South Africa . The Ewaso Lions Project protects lions in the Samburu National Reserve , Buffalo Springs National Reserve and Shaba National Reserve of the Ewaso Ng'iro ecosystem in Northern Kenya . [ 158 ] Outside these areas, the issues arising from lions' interaction with livestock and people usually results in the elimination of the former. [ 159 ] In India, the last refuge of the Asiatic lion is the 1,412 km 2 (545 sq mi) Gir Forest National Park in western India which had approximately 180 lions in 1974 and about 400 in 2010. [ 24 ] As in Africa, numerous human habitations are close by with the resultant problems between lions, livestock, locals and wildlife officials. [ 160 ] The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project plans to establish a second independent population of Asiatic lions at the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh . [ 161 ] It is important to start a second population to serve as a gene pool for the last surviving Asiatic lions and to help develop and maintain genetic diversity enabling the species to survive.
The former popularity of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal has meant that scattered lions in captivity are likely to be descended from Barbary lion stock. This includes lions at Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent , England that are descended from animals owned by the King of Morocco . [ 162 ] Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in Addis Ababa zoo, descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie . WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University , launched their ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco . [ 55 ]
Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan , a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure , having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem. [ 16 ]
Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that are the core of zoo exhibits since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible. [ 163 ] Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, [ 164 ] there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. [ 165 ] Lions can reach an age of over 20 years in captivity; Apollo, a resident lion of Honolulu Zoo in Honolulu , Hawaii , died at age 22 in August 2007. His two sisters, born in 1986, were still alive in August 2007. [ 166 ] Breeding programs need to note origins to avoid breeding different subspecies and thus reducing conservation value. [ 167 ] However, several Asiatic-African lion crosses have been breed. [ 168 ]
At the ancient Egyptian cities of Taremu and Per-Bast were temples to the lioness goddesses of Egypt, Sekhmet and Bast and at Taremu there was a temple to the son of the deity, Maahes the lion prince, where live lions were kept and allowed to roam within his temple. The Greeks called the city Leontopolis, the "City of Lions" and documented that practice. Lions were kept and bred by Assyrian kings as early as 850 BC, [ 147 ] and Alexander the Great was said to have been presented with tame lions by the Malhi of northern India. [ 169 ] Later in Roman times, lions were kept by emperors to take part in the gladiator arenas or for executions (see bestiarii , damnatio ad bestias , and venatio ). Roman notables, including Sulla , Pompey , and Julius Caesar , often ordered the mass slaughter of hundreds of lions at a time. [ 170 ] In the East, lions were tamed by Indian princes, and Marco Polo reported that Kublai Khan kept lions inside. [ 171 ] The first European "zoos" spread amongst noble and royal families in the thirteenth century, and until the seventeenth century were called seraglios ; at that time, they came to be called menageries , an extension of the cabinet of curiosities . They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe. [ 172 ] In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, Lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the thirteenth century, [ 173 ] [ 174 ] probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his palace in Woodstock , near Oxford ; where lions had reportedly been stocked by William of Malmesbury . [ 175 ]
Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and elephants , in particular, symbolised power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric. [ 176 ]
The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou the wife of Henry VI , either sought or were given animals. Records indicate they were kept in poor conditions there in the seventeenth century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time. [ 177 ] The menagerie was open to the public by the eighteenth century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions. [ 178 ] A rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early nineteenth century. [ 179 ] The Tower menagerie was closed down by William IV , [ 178 ] and animals transferred to the London Zoo which opened its gates to the public on 27 April 1828. [ 180 ]
The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than giant pandas . [ 181 ] Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation. [ 182 ] The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. [ 183 ] Explorers and hunters exploited a popular Manichean division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures. This resulted in big cats, always suspected of being man-eaters, representing "both the fear of nature and the satisfaction of having overcome it." [ 184 ]
Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. [ 185 ] Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo , among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. [ 186 ] In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park . [ 16 ] Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam. There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness Elsa , who was raised by George Adamson and his wife Joy Adamson and came to develop a strong bond with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films.
Lion-baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in Vienna by 1800 and England in 1835. [ 187 ] [ 188 ]
Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy . The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers , leopards , and cougars . The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. [ 189 ] Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. [ 189 ] The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965). [ 190 ]
The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong and noble. A common depiction is their representation as " king of the jungle" or "king of beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness, [ 191 ] as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several fables of the sixth century BC Greek storyteller Aesop . [ 192 ]
Representations of lions date back to the early Upper Paleolithic . The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The sculpture has been determined to be at least 32,000 years old from the Aurignacian culture, [ 15 ] but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. [ 193 ] The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic , giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it also may represent a deity .
Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave , discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000 years of age, [ 35 ] though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux. [ 194 ]
Ancient Egypt venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) as their war deities and among those in the Egyptian pantheon are, Bast , Mafdet , Menhit , Pakhet , Sekhmet , Tefnut , and the Sphinx ; [ 191 ] The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo , and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero Heracles . [ 195 ]
The lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia (from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times), where it was strongly associated with kingship. [ 196 ] The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, is often referred to as the striding lion of Babylon . It is in Babylon that the biblical Daniel is said to have been delivered from the lion's den. [ 197 ]
In the Talmud , Chullin 59b , Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah tells Emperor Hadrian about the giant lion of the forest of Bei Ilai called the Tigris , a lion so huge that the space between its ears measures 9 cubits . The emperor asks the rabbi to call forth this lion. He reluctantly agrees. At a distance of 400 parasangs from Rome it roars, and all pregnant women miscarry and all the walls of Rome fall down. Then it comes to 300 parasangs and roars, and all the front teeth and molars of Roman men fall out, and even the emperor himself falls from his throne. He begs the rabbi to send it back. The rabbi prays and it returns to its place.
In the Puranic texts of Hinduism , Narasimha ("man-lion") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or ( avatar ) of Vishnu , is worshipped by his devotees and saved the child devotee Prahlada from his father, the evil demon king Hiranyakashipu ; [ 198 ] Vishnu takes the form of half-man/half- lion , in Narasimha, having a human torso and lower body, but with a lion-like face and claws. [ 199 ] Singh is an ancient Indian vedic name meaning "lion" ( Asiatic lion ), dating back over 2000 years to ancient India . It was originally only used by Rajputs a Hindu Kshatriya or military caste in India. After the birth of the Khalsa brotherhood in 1699, the Sikhs also adopted the name "Singh" due to the wishes of Guru Gobind Singh . Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million Sikhs worldwide. [ 200 ] Found famously on numerous flags and coats of arms all across Asia and Europe, the Asiatic lions also stand firm on the National Emblem of India . [ 201 ] Farther south on the Indian subcontinent , the Asiatic lion is symbolic for the Sinhalese , [ 202 ] Sri Lanka 's ethnic majority; the term derived from the Indo-Aryan Sinhala , meaning the "lion people" or "people with lion blood", while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the national flag of Sri Lanka . [ 203 ]
The Asiatic lion is a common motif in Chinese art . They were first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn Period (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), when imperial guardian lions started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty (after the sixth century AD), lions usually were wingless, with shorter, thicker bodies, and curly manes. [ 204 ] The lion dance is a form of traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums, and gongs. They are performed at Chinese New Year , the August Moon Festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck. [ 205 ]
The island nation of Singapore derives its name from the Malay words singa (lion) and pora (city/fortress), which in turn is from the Tamil - Sanskrit சிங்க singa सिंह siṃha and पुर புர pura , which is cognate to the Greek πόλις , pólis . [ 206 ] According to the Malay Annals , this name was given by a fourteenth-century Sumatran Malay prince named Sang Nila Utama , who, on alighting the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast on shore which appeared to be a lion. [ 207 ]
The name of the nomadic Hadendoa people, inhabiting parts of Sudan , Egypt , and Eritrea , is made up of haɖa 'lion' and (n)ɖiwa 'clan'. Other variants are Haɖai ɖiwa , Hanɖiwa , and Haɖaatʼar (children of lioness).
"Lion" was the nickname of several medieval warrior rulers with a reputation for bravery, such as the English King Richard the Lionheart , [ 191 ] Henry the Lion , ( German : Heinrich der Löwe ), Duke of Saxony , William the Lion , King of Scotland, and Robert III of Flanders nicknamed "The Lion of Flanders"—a major Flemish national icon up to the present. Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms , either as a device on shields themselves, or as supporters , but the lioness is much more infrequent. [ 208 ] The formal language of heraldry , called blazon , employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specified whether lions or other creatures were "rampant" or "passant", that is whether they were rearing or crouching. [ 209 ] The lion is used as a symbol of sporting teams, from national association football teams such as England , Scotland and Singapore to famous clubs such as the Detroit Lions [ 210 ] of the NFL, Chelsea [ 211 ] and Aston Villa of the English Premier League , [ 212 ] (and the Premiership itself), Eintracht Braunschweig of the Bundesliga , and to a host of smaller clubs around the world.
Lions continue to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis , [ 213 ] to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . [ 214 ] The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion , which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. [ 215 ] The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free , [ 216 ] based on the true-life international bestselling book of the same title. [ 217 ] The lion's role as King of the Beasts has been used in cartoons, from the 1950s manga which gave rise to the first Japanese colour TV animation series, Kimba the White Lion , Leonardo Lion of King Leonardo and his Short Subjects , both from the 1960s, up to the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King , [ 218 ] [ 219 ] which also featured the popular song " The Lion Sleeps Tonight " in its soundtrack. A lion appears on the 50-rand South African banknote .
Honey / ˈ h ʌ n i / is a sweet food made by bees using nectar from flowers. The variety produced by honey bees (the genus Apis ) is the one most commonly referred to, as it is the type of honey collected by most beekeepers and consumed by people. Honeys produced by other bees ( bumblebees , stingless bees ) and other hymenoptera insects (e. g. honey wasps ) have different properties, and are discussed only briefly in this article.
Honey bees transform nectar into honey by a process of regurgitation and evaporation. They store it as a primary food source in wax honeycombs inside the beehive .
Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose , and has approximately the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it over sugar and other sweeteners. [ 1 ] Most microorganisms do not grow in honey because of its low water activity of 0.6. [ 3 ] However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum , which can be dangerous to infants, as the endospores can transform into toxin-producing bacteria in infants' immature intestinal tracts, leading to illness and even death. [ 4 ]
Honey has had a long history in human consumption, and is used in various foods and beverages as a sweetener and flavoring. It also has a role in religion and symbolism. Flavors of honey vary based on the nectar source, and various types and grades of honey are available. It has also been used in various medicinal traditions to treat ailments. The study of pollens and spores in honey ( melissopalynology ) can determine floral sources of honey. [ 5 ] Bees carry an electrostatic charge whereby they attract other particles in addition to pollen, which become incorporated into their honey; honey can be analysed by the technique of melissopalynology , in the area of environmental studies of radioactive particles, dust and particulate pollution . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]


Honey's natural sugars are dehydrated, which prevents fermentation, with added enzymes to modify and transform their chemical composition and pH. Invertases and digestive acids hydrolyze sucrose to give the monosaccharides glucose and fructose. Invertase is one of these enzymes synthesized by the body of the insect.
Honey bees transform saccharides into honey by a process of regurgitation , a number of times, until it is partially digested. The bees do the regurgitation and digestion as a group. After the last regurgitation, the aqueous solution is still high in water, so the process continues by evaporation of much of the water and enzymatic transformation.
Honey is produced by bees as a food source. To produce a single jar of honey (1lb or 454 g),foraging honey bees have to travel the equivalent of three times around the world. [ 8 ] In cold weather or when fresh food sources are scarce, bees use their stored honey as their source of energy. [ 9 ] By contriving for bee swarms to nest in artificial hives , people have been able to semidomesticate the insects, and harvest excess honey. In the hive (or in a wild nest), there are three types of bees:
The worker bees raise larvae and collect the nectar that will become honey in the hive. Leaving the hive, they collect sugar-rich flower nectar and return.
In the hive, the bees use their "honey stomachs" to ingest and regurgitate the nectar a number of times until it is partially digested. [ 11 ] Invertase synthesized by the bees and digestive acids hydrolyze sucrose to give the same mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion until the product reaches a desired quality. It is then stored in honeycomb cells. After the final regurgitation, the honeycomb is left unsealed. However, the nectar is still high in both water content and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the nectar to ferment. [ 9 ] The process continues as bees inside the hive fan their wings, creating a strong draft across the honeycomb, which enhances evaporation of much of the water from the nectar. [ 9 ] This reduction in water content raises the sugar concentration and prevents fermentation . Ripe honey, as removed from the hive by a beekeeper , has a long shelf life, and will not ferment if properly sealed. [ 9 ]
Another source of honey is from a number of wasp species, such as the wasps Brachygastra lecheguana and Brachygastra mellifica , which is found in South and Central America. This species is known to feed on nectar and produce honey. [ 12 ]
Some wasps, such as the Polistes versicolor , even consume honey themselves, switching from feeding on pollen in the middle of their life cycles to feeding on honey, which can better provide for their energetic needs. [ 13 ]
The physical properties of honey vary, depending on water content, the type of flora used to produce it (pasturage), temperature, and the proportion of the specific sugars it contains. Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a supercooled liquid, in which the glucose will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of precipitated glucose crystals in a solution of fructose and other ingredients.
The melting point of crystallized honey is between 40 and 50 °C (104 and 122 °F), depending on its composition. Below this temperature, honey can be either in a metastable state, meaning that it will not crystallize until a seed crystal is added, or, more often, it is in a "labile" state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously. [ 14 ] The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as brassica honey, will crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or tupelo honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others will produce many small crystals. [ 15 ]
Crystallization is also affected by water content, because a high percentage of water will inhibit crystallization, as will a high dextrin content. Temperature also affects the rate of crystallization, with the fastest growth occurring between 13 and 17 °C (55 and 63 °F). Crystal nuclei (seeds) tend to form more readily if the honey is disturbed, by stirring, shaking or agitating, rather than if left at rest. However, the nucleation of microscopic seed-crystals is greatest between 5 and 8 °C (41 and 46 °F). Therefore, larger but fewer crystals tend to form at higher temperatures, while smaller but more-numerous crystals usually form at lower temperatures. Below 5 °C, the honey will not crystallize and, thus, the original texture and flavor can be preserved indefinitely. [ 15 ]
Since honey normally exists below its melting point, it is a supercooled liquid. At very low temperatures, honey will not freeze solid. Instead, as the temperatures become lower, the viscosity of honey increases. Like most viscous liquids , the honey will become thick and sluggish with decreasing temperature. At −20 °C (−4 °F), honey may appear or even feel solid, but it will continue to flow at very low rates. Honey has a glass transition between −42 and −51 °C (−44 and −60 °F). Below this temperature, honey enters a glassy state and will become an amorphous solid (noncrystalline). [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
The viscosity of honey is affected greatly by both temperature and water content. The higher the water percentage, the easier honey will flow. Above its melting point, however, water has little effect on viscosity. Aside from water content, the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity, with the exception of a few types. At 25 °C (77 °F), honey with 14% water content will generally have a viscosity of around 400 poise , while a honey containing 20% water will have a viscosity of around 20 poise. Viscosity increase due to temperature occurs very slowly at first. A honey containing 16% water, at 70 °C (158 °F), will have a viscosity of around 2 poise, while at 30 °C (86 °F), the viscosity will be around 70 poise. As cooling progresses, honey will become more viscous at an increasingly rapid rate, reaching 600 poise around 14 °C (57 °F). However, while honey is very viscous, it has rather low surface tension . [ 18 ] [ 19 ]
A few types of honey have unusual viscous properties. Honey from heather or manuka display thixotropic properties. These types of honey enter a gel-like state when motionless, but then liquify when stirred. [ 20 ]
Since honey contains electrolytes , in the form of acids and minerals, it exhibits varying degrees of electrical conductivity . Measurements of the electrical conductivity are used to determine the quality of honey in terms of ash content. [ 19 ]
The effect honey has on light is useful for determining the type and quality. Variations in the water content alter the refractive index of honey. Water content can easily be measured with a refractometer . Typically, the refractive index for honey will range from 1.504 at 13% water content to 1.474 at 25%. Honey also has an effect on polarized light , in that it will rotate the polarization plane. The fructose will give a negative rotation, while the glucose will give a positive one. The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture. [ 19 ] [ 21 ]
Honey has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air, a phenomenon called hygroscopy . The amount of water the honey will absorb is dependent on the relative humidity of the air. Because honey contains yeast , this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent fermentation , which usually begins if the honey's water content rises much above 25%. Honey will tend to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars would allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains. [ 21 ]
Fermentation of honey will usually occur after crystallization because, without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of the fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth. Honey that is to be stored at room temperature for long periods of time is often pasteurized , to kill any yeast, by heating it above 70 °C (158 °F). [ 21 ]
Like all sugar compounds, honey will caramelize if heated sufficiently, becoming darker in color, and eventually burn. However, honey contains fructose, which caramelizes at lower temperatures than the glucose. [ 22 ] The temperature at which caramelization begins varies, depending on the composition, but is typically between 70 and 110 °C (158 and 230 °F). Honey also contains acids, which act as catalysts , decreasing the caramelization temperature even more. [ 23 ] Of these acids, the amino acids, which occur in very small amounts, play an important role in the darkening of honey. The amino acids form darkened compounds called melanoidins , during a Maillard reaction . The Maillard reaction will occur slowly at room temperature, taking from a few to several months to show visible darkening, but will speed-up dramatically with increasing temperatures. However, the reaction can also be slowed by storing the honey at colder temperatures. [ 24 ]
Unlike many other liquids, honey has very poor thermal conductivity , taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium . Melting crystallized honey can easily result in localized caramelization if the heat source is too hot, or if it is not evenly distributed. However, honey will take substantially longer to liquify when just above the melting point than it will at elevated temperatures. [ 19 ] Melting 20 kilograms of crystallized honey, at 40 °C (104 °F), can take up to 24 hours, while 50 kilograms may take twice as long. These times can be cut nearly in half by heating at 50 °C (122 °F). However, many of the minor substances in honey can be affected greatly by heating, changing the flavor, aroma, or other properties, so heating is usually done at the lowest temperature possible for the shortest amount of time. [ 25 ]
The average pH of honey is 3.9, but can range from 3.4 to 6.1. Honey contains many kinds of acids , both organic and amino . However, the different types and their amounts vary considerably, depending on the type of honey. These acids may be aromatic or aliphatic (non-aromatic). The aliphatic acids contribute greatly to the flavor of honey by interacting with the flavors of other ingredients. Gluconic acid , for instance, is a flavor enhancer.
Honey can contain up to 18 of the 20 amino acids. However, amino acid content is almost negligible in honey, accounting for only 0.05–0.1% of the composition. The main amino acid is proline . Amino acids are derived almost solely from the bodies of the bees.
Organic acids comprise most of the acids in honey, accounting for 0.17–1.17% of the mixture. Gluconic acid is the most prevalent. Gluconic acid is formed by the actions of an enzyme called glucose oxidase . Other organic acids are minor, consisting of formic , acetic , butyric , citric , lactic , malic, pyroglutamic , propionic , valeric , capronic , palmitic , and succinic , among many others. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
Honey use and production has a long and varied history. In many cultures, honey has associations that go beyond its use as a food. Honey is frequently used as a talisman and symbol of sweetness. [ citation needed ]
Honey collection is an ancient activity. Humans apparently began hunting for honey at least 8,000 years ago, as evidenced by a cave painting in Valencia , Spain . [ 28 ] The painting is a Mesolithic rock painting, showing two honey-hunters collecting honey and honeycomb from a wild bee nest. The figures are depicted carrying baskets or gourds, and using a ladder or series of ropes to reach the wild nest.
The Greater Honeyguide bird guides humans to wild bee hives [ 29 ] and this behavior may have evolved with early hominids [ 30 ] [ 31 ]
So far, the oldest remains of honey have been found in the country of Georgia . Archaeologists have found honey remains on the inner surface of clay vessels unearthed an ancient tomb, dating back to some 4,700–5,500 years ago. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In ancient Georgia, honey was packed for people's journeys into the afterlife. And more than one type, too – along for the trip were linden, berry, and a meadow-flower variety. [ 34 ]
In ancient Egypt , honey was used to sweeten cakes and biscuits, and was used in many other dishes. Ancient Egyptian and Middle Eastern peoples also used honey for embalming the dead. [ 35 ] The fertility god of Egypt, Min , was offered honey.
The spiritual and therapeutic use of honey in ancient India is documented in both the Vedas and the Ayurveda texts, which were both composed at least 4,000 years ago. [ 36 ]
Pliny the Elder devotes considerable space in his book Naturalis Historia to the bee and honey, and its many uses. In the absence of sugar, Honey was an integral sweetening ingredient in Roman recipes, and references to its use in food can be found in the work of many Roman authors including Athenaeus , Cato and Bassus [ disambiguation needed ] . [ citation needed ]
The art of beekeeping in ancient China has existed since time immemorial and appears to be untraceable to its origin. In the book "Golden Rules of Business Success" written by Fan Li (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the Spring and Autumn Period , there are some parts mentioning the art of beekeeping and the importance of the quality of the wooden box for bee keeping that can affect the quality of its honey. [ citation needed ]
Honey was also cultivated in ancient Mesoamerica . The Maya used honey from the stingless bee for culinary purposes, and continue to do so today. The Maya also regard the bee as sacred (see Mayan stingless bees of Central America ).
Some cultures believed honey had many practical health uses. It was used as an ointment for rashes and burns, and to help soothe sore throats when no other practices were available.
In Hinduism , honey ( Madhu ) is one of the five elixirs of immortality ( Panchamrita ). In temples, honey is poured over the deities in a ritual called Madhu abhisheka . The Vedas and other ancient literature mention the use of honey as a great medicinal and health food. [ 37 ]
In Jewish tradition, honey is a symbol for the new year, Rosh Hashanah . At the traditional meal for that holiday, apple slices are dipped in honey and eaten to bring a sweet new year. Some Rosh Hashanah greetings show honey and an apple, symbolizing the feast. In some congregations, small straws of honey are given out to usher in the new year. [ citation needed ]
The Hebrew Bible contains many references to honey. In the Book of Judges , Samson found a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of a lion (14:8). In Old Testament law, offerings were made in the temple to God. The Book of Leviticus says that “Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord” (2:11). In the Books of Samuel Jonathan is forced into a confrontation with his father King Saul after eating honey in violation of a rash oath Saul made (14:24–47). The Book of Exodus famously describes the Promised Land as a "land flowing with milk and honey" (33:3). However, the claim has been advanced that the original Hebrew (דבש devash ) actually refers to the sweet syrup produced from the juice of dates . [ 38 ] Pure honey is considered kosher even though it is produced by a flying insect, a nonkosher creature; other products of nonkosher animals are not kosher. [ 39 ]
In Buddhism, honey plays an important role in the festival of Madhu Purnima , celebrated in India and Bangladesh . The day commemorates Buddha 's making peace among his disciples by retreating into the wilderness. The legend has it that while he was there, a monkey brought him honey to eat. On Madhu Purnima, Buddhists remember this act by giving honey to monks . The monkey's gift is frequently depicted in Buddhist art . [ 37 ]
In the Christian New Testament , Matthew 3:4 , John the Baptist is said to have lived for a long period of time in the wilderness on a diet consisting of locusts and wild honey.
In Islam, there is an entire Surah in the Qur'an called an-Nahl (the Bee). According to hadith , Prophet Muhammad strongly recommended honey for healing purposes. [ 40 ] The Qur'an promotes honey as a nutritious and healthy food. Below is the English translation of those specific verses.
"And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations; Then to eat of all the produce (of the earth), and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought" [Al-Quran 16:68–69].

Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from domesticated beehives . Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a honeyguide bird. The bees may first be pacified by using smoke from a bee smoker . The smoke triggers a feeding instinct (an attempt to save the resources of the hive from a possible fire), making them less aggressive and the smoke obscures the pheromones the bees use to communicate.
The honeycomb is removed from the hive and the honey may be extracted from that, either by crushing or by using a honey extractor . The honey is then usually filtered to remove beeswax and other debris.
Before the invention of removable frames, bee colonies were often sacrificed in order to conduct the harvest. The harvester would take all the available honey and replace the entire colony the next spring. Since the invention of removable frames, the principles of husbandry lead most beekeepers to ensure that their bees will have enough stores to survive the winter, either by leaving some honey in the beehive or by providing the colony with a honey substitute such as sugar water or crystalline sugar (often in the form of a "candyboard"). The amount of food necessary to survive the winter depends on the race of bees and on the length and severity of local winters.
The main uses of honey are in cooking , baking, as a spread on bread , and as an addition to various beverages, such as tea , and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages. According to The National Honey Board (a USDA-overseen organization), "honey stipulates a pure product that does not allow for the addition of any other substance...this includes, but is not limited to, water or other sweeteners ". [ 42 ] Honey barbecue and honey mustard are common and popular sauce flavors.
Honey is the main ingredient in the alcoholic beverage mead , which is also known as "honey wine" or "honey beer". Historically, the ferment for mead was honey's naturally occurring yeast. Honey is also used as an adjunct in some beers .
Honey wine, or mead, is typically (modern era) made with a honey and water mixture with a pack of yeast added for fermentation. Primary fermentation usually takes 40 days, after which the must needs to be racked into a secondary fermentation vessel and left to sit about 35–40 more days. If done properly, fermentation will be finished by this point (though if a sparkling mead is desired, fermentation can be restarted after bottling by the addition of a small amount of sugar), but most meads require aging for 6–9 months or more in order to be palatable.
Honey is a mixture of sugars and other compounds. With respect to carbohydrates, honey is mainly fructose (about 38.5%) and glucose (about 31.0%), [ 1 ] making it similar to the synthetically produced inverted sugar syrup , which is approximately 48% fructose, 47% glucose, and 5% sucrose . Honey's remaining carbohydrates include maltose , sucrose, and other complex carbohydrates . [ 1 ] As with all nutritive sweeteners, honey is mostly sugars and contains only trace amounts of vitamins or minerals . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Honey also contains tiny amounts of several compounds thought to function as antioxidants , including chrysin , pinobanksin , vitamin C , catalase , and pinocembrin . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ vague ] The specific composition of any batch of honey depends on the flowers available to the bees that produced the honey. [ 43 ]
Typical honey analysis: [ 47 ]
Its glycemic index ranges from 31 to 78, depending on the variety. [ 48 ]
Honey has a density of about 1.36 kilograms per litre (36% denser than water). [ 49 ]
Adulteration of honey is the addition of other sugars, syrups or compounds into honey to change its flavor, viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or to increase the fructose content in order to stave off crystallization. According to the Codex Alimentarius of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling. [ 50 ] Adulteration of honey is sometimes used as a method of deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey. [ 51 ]
Isotope ratio mass spectrometry can be used to detect addition of corn syrup and cane sugar by the carbon isotopic signature . Addition of sugars originating from corn or sugar cane ( C4 plants , unlike the plants used by bees, and also sugar beet , which are predominantly C3 plants ) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey, [ 52 ] but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins. In an unadulterated honey, the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match. Levels as low as 7% of addition can be detected. [ 53 ]
Honey is classified by its floral source, and there are also divisions according to the packaging and processing used. There are also regional honeys . In the USA honey is also graded on its color and optical density by USDA standards, graded on a scale called the Pfund scale, which ranges from 0 for "water white" honey to more than 114 for "dark amber" honey. [ 54 ]
Generally, honey is classified by the floral source of the nectar from which it was made. Honeys can be from specific types of flower nectars or can be blended after collection. The pollen in honey is traceable to floral source and therefore region of origin. The rheological & melissopalynological properties of honey can be used to identify the major plant nectar source used in its production. [ 55 ]
Most commercially available honey is blended, meaning it is a mixture of two or more honeys differing in floral source, color, flavor, density or geographic origin. [ 56 ]
Polyfloral honey, also known as wildflower honey, [ 57 ] is derived from the nectar of many types of flowers. [ 58 ]
The taste may vary from year to year, and the aroma and the flavor can be more or less intense, depending on which bloomings are prevalent. [ 59 ]
Monofloral honey is made primarily from the nectar of one type of flower. Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal nectar sources . [ 60 ] To produce monofloral honey, beekeepers keep beehives in an area where the bees have access to only one type of flower. In practice, because of the difficulties in containing bees, a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types. [ citation needed ] Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are clover , orange blossom, blueberry , sage, tupelo , buckwheat , fireweed , mesquite and sourwood . Some typical European examples include thyme , thistle , heather , acacia , dandelion , sunflower , honeysuckle , and varieties from lime and chestnut trees. [ citation needed ] In North Africa (e.g. Egypt ) examples include clover , cotton , and citrus (mainly orange blossoms ). [ citation needed ]
Instead of taking nectar, bees can take honeydew , the sweet secretions of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, with a rich fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as sweet as nectar honeys. [ 60 ] Germany 's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, as well as some regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production. [ 61 ] Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger flavored product.
The production of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers. The honey has a much larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys, thus causing dysentery to the bees, resulting in the death of colonies in areas with cold winters. Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas. Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements, as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.
Generally, honey is bottled in its familiar liquid form. However, honey is sold in other forms, and can be subjected to a variety of processing methods.
Because of its unique composition and chemical properties, honey is suitable for long-term storage, and is easily assimilated even after long preservation. Honey, and objects immersed in honey, have been preserved for decades and even centuries. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] The key to preservation is limiting access to humidity. In its cured state, honey has a sufficiently high sugar content to inhibit fermentation. If exposed to moist air, its hydrophilic properties will pull moisture into the honey, eventually diluting it to the point that fermentation can begin.
Regardless of preservation, honey may crystallize over time. The crystals can be dissolved by heating the honey. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]
In the US, honey grading is performed voluntarily (USDA does offer inspection and grading "as on-line (in-plant) or lot inspection...upon application, on a fee-for-service basis.") based upon USDA standards. Honey is graded based upon a number of factors, including water content, flavor and aroma, absence of defects and clarity. Honey is also classified by color though it is not a factor in the grading scale. [ 77 ] The honey grade scale is:
Other countries may have differing standards on the grading of honey. India , for example, certifies honey grades based on additional factors, such as the Fiehe's test, and other empirical measurements. [ 78 ]
High-quality honey can be distinguished by fragrance, taste, and consistency. Ripe, freshly collected, high-quality honey at 20 °C (68 °F) should flow from a knife in a straight stream, without breaking into separate drops. [ 79 ] After falling down, the honey should form a bead. The honey, when poured, should form small, temporary layers that disappear fairly quickly, indicating high viscosity. If not, it indicates excessive water content (over 20%) [ 79 ] of the product. Honey with excessive water content is not suitable for long-term preservation. [ 80 ]
In jars, fresh honey should appear as a pure, consistent fluid, and should not set in layers. Within a few weeks to a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of 40–49 °C (104–120 °F) to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, diastase activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the Phadebas methods. A fluffy film on the surface of the honey (like a white foam), or marble-colored or white-spotted crystallization on a containers sides, is formed by air bubbles trapped during the bottling process.
A 2008 Italian study determined nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between different honey types, and can be used to pinpoint the area where it was produced. Researchers were able to identify differences in acacia and polyfloral honeys by the differing proportions of fructose and sucrose , as well as differing levels of aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine . This ability allows greater ease of selecting compatible stocks. [ 81 ]
Historically, honey has been used by humans both orally and topically to treat various ailments including gastric disturbances, ulcers, wounds, and burns.
Honey was used medicinally by ancient Greeks and Egyptians and has been traditionally used in Ayurveda in India and in Traditional Chinese Medicine . [ 36 ] [ 82 ]
The Quran mentions honey as medicine. [ 41 ] [ 82 ]
Medieval Islamic and Christian scholars described the use of honey in medicine of that period. [ 82 ]
Per traditional yoga practice, daily consumption of honey mixed with warm water is said to strengthen the circulatory system, and is therefore recommended. [ 83 ] A honey and warm water mixture is also recommended by yoga practitioners for asthmatics. [ 84 ] [ dubious – discuss ]
The potential health benefits of honey have been studied in clinical trials and other experiments according to the scientific method . Little to no efficacy has been identified.
Consumption of honey is sometimes advocated as a treatment for seasonal allergies due to pollen, however, honey is generally considered ineffective for the treatment of rhinosinusitis . [ 85 ]
There is some weak evidence that honey may help treat mild burns if used in a dressing. [ 86 ]
Honey has been promoted as being potentially of use in the treatment of cancer. [ 87 ] However, while experiments have found honey can—in common with many substances—kill cancer cells in the laboratory, there is no evidence of its benefit treating cancer in people. [ 87 ]
There is little evidence for or against honey as treatment of coughs for children. For chronic cough and acute cough, Cochrane systematic reviews found that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of honey. [ 88 ] [ 89 ]
Regulatory authorities in the US and the UK recommend avoiding giving over the counter cold medication to children. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] The UK authorities recommend "a warm drink of lemon and honey or a simple cough syrup that contains glycerol or honey" in children instead, but warn that honey should not be given to very young children because of the risk of infant botulism. [ 90 ]
People who are immunocompromised should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. [ 87 ]
Honey is of no benefit in treating ingrown toenail . [ 92 ]
Evidence does not support the use of honey-based products for the treatment of venous leg ulcers . [ 93 ]
Infants can contract botulism from honey. [ 94 ]
Infantile botulism shows geographical variation. In the UK, only six cases have been reported between 1976 and 2006, [ 95 ] yet the U.S. has much higher rates: 1.9 per 100,000 live births, 47.2% of which are in California. [ 96 ] While the risk honey poses to infant health is small, it is recommended not to take the risk. [ 97 ]
Honey produced from flowers of oleanders , rhododendrons , mountain laurels , sheep laurel , and azaleas may cause honey intoxication . Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, nausea, and vomiting. Less commonly, low blood pressure, shock, heart rhythm irregularities, and convulsions may occur, with rare cases resulting in death. Honey intoxication is more likely when using "natural" unprocessed honey and honey from farmers who may have a small number of hives. Commercial processing, with pooling of honey from numerous sources, is thought to dilute any toxins. [ 98 ]
Toxic honey may also result when bees are proximate to tutu bushes ( Coriaria arborea ) and the vine hopper insect ( Scolypopa australis ). Both are found throughout New Zealand. Bees gather honeydew produced by the vine hopper insects feeding on the tutu plant. This introduces the poison tutin into honey. [ 99 ] Only a few areas in New Zealand (Coromandel Peninsula, Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Marlborough Sound) frequently produce toxic honey. Symptoms of tutin poisoning include vomiting, delirium, giddiness, increased excitability, stupor, coma, and violent convulsions. To reduce the risk of tutin poisoning, humans should not eat honey taken from feral hives in the risk areas of New Zealand. Since December 2001, New Zealand beekeepers have been required to reduce the risk of producing toxic honey by closely monitoring tutu, vine hopper, and foraging conditions within 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) of their apiary.
As of 2012, China , Turkey , and Argentina were the top producers of natural honey, followed by Ukraine and the United States. [ 100 ]
Mexico is also an important producer of honey, providing more than 4% of the world's supply. [ 101 ] Much of this (about one-third) comes from the Yucatán Peninsula . Honey production began there when the Apis mellifera and the A. mellifera ligustica were introduced there early in the 20th century. Most of Mexico's Yucatán producers are small, family operations who use original traditional techniques, moving hives to take advantage of the various tropical and subtropical flowers. [ 102 ]
Honey is also one of the gourmet products of the French island of Corsica . Corsican honey is certified as to its origin ( Appellation d'origine contrôlée ) just as are French wines, like Champagne. [ 103 ]
Honey consumption per capita per year exceeds one kilogram in some countries like Austria, Germany and Switzerland. [ 104 ]

Abraham Lincoln i / ˈ eɪ b r ə h æ m ˈ l ɪ ŋ k ən / (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th president of the United States , serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 . Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War —its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional and political crisis. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] In doing so, he preserved the Union , abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.
Reared in a poor family on the western frontier , Lincoln was a self-educated lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , state legislator during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the Congress during the 1840s. He promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, canals, railroads and tariffs to encourage the building of factories; he opposed the war with Mexico in 1846. After a series of highly publicized debates in 1858, during which Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, he lost the U.S. Senate race to his archrival, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas .
In 1860 Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state. With very little support in the slave states, Lincoln swept the North and was elected president in 1860 . His election prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederacy before he took the office. No compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery.
When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the Union after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He unilaterally suspended habeas corpus , arresting and temporarily detaining thousands holding secessionist or anti-war views in the border states without trial, ignoring the ruling by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice that such suspension was unconstitutional (unless done by Congress). Lincoln averted potential British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861. His complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, using the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general Ulysses S. Grant . He made the major decisions on Union war strategy. Lincoln's Navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, helped take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and gained control of the Southern river system using gunboats. Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.
An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to " War Democrats " (who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats who called for more compromise, antiwar Democrats called Copperheads who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory, and by carefully planned political patronage. [ 3 ] His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a noted actor and Confederate sympathizer.
Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars [ 4 ] and the public [ 5 ] as one of the greatest U.S. presidents.


Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm in Hardin County , Kentucky [ 6 ] (now LaRue County ). He is descended from Samuel Lincoln , who arrived in Hingham , Massachusetts, from Norfolk , England, in the 17th century. [ 7 ] Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, Abraham , had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, as his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looked on. [ 8 ] Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier. [ 9 ]
Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now Mineral County , West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought or leased several farms, including Knob Creek Farm . The family attended a Separate Baptists church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. [ 10 ] Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two 600-acre (240 ha) farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county. However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles. [ 11 ] According to William Ensign Lincoln's book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln , Abraham Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks, was the daughter of Joseph Hanks and Nancy Shipley. [ 12 ]
The family moved north across the Ohio River to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then Perry County but is now Spencer County, Indiana . Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery" but mainly due to land title difficulties. [ 11 ] In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of milk sickness in 1818. After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister, Sarah , took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son. [ 13 ]
Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow Sarah Bush Johnston , the mother of three children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as "Mother". [ 14 ] As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, "the Clary's Grove boys". [ 17 ]
Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21. [ 18 ] In later years, Lincoln occasionally lent his father money. [ 19 ] Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education. While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village. He read and reread the King James Bible , Aesop 's Fables, Bunyan 's Pilgrim's Progress, Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe, and Franklin 's Autobiography. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land 10 miles west of Decatur , in Macon County , Illinois, another free, non-slave state. [ 22 ] In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County , Illinois. It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old who was now old enough to make his own decisions, Lincoln struck out on his own. Canoeing down the Sangamon River , Lincoln ended up in the village of New Salem in Sangamon County . [ 23 ] In the spring of 1831, hired by a New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods by flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home. [ 24 ]
Lincoln's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge , whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever . [ 25 ] In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. [ 26 ]
Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended. [ 26 ]
In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd , who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in Lexington , Kentucky. [ 27 ] They met in Springfield , Illinois, in December 1839 [ 28 ] and were engaged the following December. [ 29 ] A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. [ 28 ] [ 30 ] They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. [ 31 ] While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose." [ 32 ]
In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl. [ 33 ] Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", [ 34 ] and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children. [ 35 ]
Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. "Willie" Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, Thomas "Tad" Lincoln , was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. [ 36 ] Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. His last descendant, great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith , died in 1985. [ 37 ]
The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875. [ 38 ] Abraham Lincoln suffered from " melancholy ," a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression . [ 39 ]
Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington. [ 40 ] He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.
In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem , Illinois. [ 41 ] Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly . He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. [ 42 ] [ 43 ]
Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War . [ 44 ] Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm), [ 45 ] he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him. [ 46 ] Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct. [ 47 ]
Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody". [ 48 ] His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a Whig , many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent. [ 49 ]
Admitted to the bar in 1836, [ 50 ] he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under John T. Stuart , Mary Todd's cousin. [ 51 ] Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844. Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon , whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man". [ 52 ]
Successful on his second run for office, Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County. [ 53 ] In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not. [ 54 ] He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism . He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." [ 55 ] His stance closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in Liberia in Africa. [ 56 ]
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be, "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay". [ 57 ] The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well. [ 58 ]
In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. [ 59 ] Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings , wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters. [ 60 ]
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican–American War , which he attributed to President Polk 's desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood". [ 61 ] Lincoln also supported the Wilmot Proviso , which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico. [ 62 ]
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions . The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil " . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil. [ 64 ]
Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln". [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers. [ 68 ]
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election . [ 69 ] Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office , but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, Justin Butterfield , considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil". [ 70 ] The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory . This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice. [ 71 ]
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer". [ 72 ] Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. [ 73 ] Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. [ 74 ] In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent. [ 77 ] [ 78 ]
In 1851, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. [ 79 ] Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. [ 81 ] From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad . [ 82 ]
Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William "Duff" Armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. [ 83 ] The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. [ 83 ]
Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison. [ 83 ] [ 84 ]
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, including Illinois, whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery, as required by the Northwest Ordinance . [ 85 ] Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west. [ 86 ] He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting Missouri Compromise (1820). Senior Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress. [ 87 ]
Eric Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers , especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence . [ 88 ]
On October 16, 1854, in his " Peoria Speech ", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. [ 89 ] Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, [ 90 ] he said the Kansas Act had a " declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..." [ 91 ]
In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. [ 92 ] After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull , who defeated opponent Joel Aldrich Matteson . [ 93 ] The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery." [ 94 ]
Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil , Liberty , and Democratic Party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party . [ 95 ] At the 1856 Republican National Convention , Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president. [ 96 ]
In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President James Buchanan , leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution , which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state . [ 97 ] In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ; Chief Justice Roger B. Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power . [ 98 ] Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'." [ 99 ]
After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech , drawing on Mark 3:25 , "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." [ 100 ] The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. [ 101 ] The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. [ 102 ]
The Senate campaign featured the seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history. [ 103 ] The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that " The Slave Power " was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal , while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. [ 104 ] The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision. [ 105 ]
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. [ 106 ] In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. [ 107 ]
On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong". [ 108 ] Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly [ 109 ] —Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist Noah Brooks reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience." [ 110 ] [ 111 ]
Historian Donald described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's ( William H. Seward ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ( Salmon P. Chase ) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery". [ 112 ] In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste is in my mouth a little." [ 113 ]
On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. [ 114 ] Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis , Norman Judd , Leonard Swett , and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. [ 115 ] Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate". [ 116 ]
On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff. [ 117 ]
On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. [ 118 ] Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me". [ 119 ]
Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. [ 120 ] Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention , disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. [ 121 ]
As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. [ 122 ] The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies. [ 123 ]
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party . He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states. [ 124 ]
Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln. [ 125 ] Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South. [ 126 ]
Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College. [ 127 ]
As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. [ 128 ] On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America . [ 129 ] The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. [ 131 ] President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. [ 132 ] The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861. [ 133 ]
There were attempts at compromise. The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. [ 134 ] Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right." [ 135 ]
Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. [ 138 ] Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution. [ 139 ]
En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. [ 140 ] The president-elect then evaded possible assassins in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, Allan Pinkerton . On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. [ 141 ] Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature." [ 143 ] The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. [ 144 ] Lincoln said as the war was ending:
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson , sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter , forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion. [ 146 ]
William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war. [ 147 ] Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that." [ 148 ]
On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of Richmond so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral. [ 149 ] The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to the defense of the American nation. Historian Allan Nevins says:
Regiments headed south to fight in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, anti-war mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops changing trains, then burned the bridges. Lincoln responded by arresting George William Brown , the Mayor of Baltimore, the entire city council, all the police commissioners, a sitting U.S. Congresman and other Maryland politicians. They were imprisoned without warrants, charges, or trials, as Lincoln unilaterally suspended the writ of habeas corpus . [ 152 ] John Merryman , a Maryland official, petitioned Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus. Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, stating that Lincoln's presidential suspension of habeas corpus was unconstitutional because only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln ignored the ruling . The Army seized control of Baltimore and federal agents imprisoned one third of the members of the Maryland General Assembly . Lincoln only released them when the Confederate threat to Maryland had ended; Merryman himself was released in July. [ 153 ] [ 154 ]
After the Battle of Fort Sumter , Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief , using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus , arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict. [ 155 ]
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. [ 156 ] On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy. [ 157 ]
In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont , the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. [ 158 ] After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops. [ 159 ]
The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the Trent , on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain. [ 160 ] Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the Trent affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator Charles Sumner , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy. [ 161 ]
To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied Henry Halleck 's book, Elements of Military Art and Science from the Library of Congress . [ 162 ] Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the War Department in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary . Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. "Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," say Thomas and Hyman. [ 163 ]
In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. [ 164 ] Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. [ 165 ] Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a student of the European strategist Jomini , of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River; [ 166 ] he also knew well the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory. [ 167 ]
After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and the retirement of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. [ 168 ] McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign , longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign. [ 169 ]
Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. [ 170 ] McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope , a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia . Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. [ 171 ]
However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. [ 171 ] The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia , formerly the USS Merrimack , damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor . Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads . [ 172 ]
Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. [ 173 ] Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee 's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. [ 174 ] The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation. [ 175 ]
McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans ; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside . Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief. [ 176 ]
Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. [ 177 ] Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker , despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship. [ 178 ]
The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. [ 179 ]
While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress". [ 179 ]
In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston. [ 180 ]
Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, [ 181 ] but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper's Ferry , and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade , who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign , which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor. [ 182 ] After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief. [ 183 ]
Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers , under the constitution. [ 184 ] President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union. [ 185 ]
On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second Confiscation Act was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free". [ 186 ]
Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy, [ 187 ] and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union: [ 188 ]
My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union ... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free. [ 189 ]
The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. [ 190 ] Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites. [ 191 ]
Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." [ 192 ] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. [ 193 ] A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference ; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army. [ 194 ]
Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Andrew Johnson , the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once". [ 195 ] By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. [ 196 ] Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color". [ 197 ]
With the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots . The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. [ 198 ] Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here," the Address became the most quoted speech in American history. [ 199 ]
In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation. [ 200 ] [ 201 ]
Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General Ulysses S. Grant 's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man. He fights." [ 202 ] With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops. [ 203 ]
Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington. [ 204 ]
Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864. This is often characterized as a war of attrition , given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor . Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". [ 205 ] The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer." [ 206 ]
The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the James River , forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia . Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. [ 207 ] Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses. [ 208 ]
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley . The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60-mile (97 km) swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in " total war " against civilians, as in World War II. [ 209 ]
Confederate general Jubal Anderson Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" [ 210 ] After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched. [ 211 ]
As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads . Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. [ 212 ] On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over. [ 213 ]

While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party . [ 216 ]
When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House: [ 217 ]
This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward. [ 218 ]
Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut 's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; [ 219 ] the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads. [ 220 ] On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote. [ 217 ] [ 221 ]
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address . In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world". [ 222 ] Lincoln said:
Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, "the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether". With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations. [ 223 ]
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy." [ 224 ] In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade , political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance. [ 225 ]
As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill , in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. [ 226 ]
Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies. [ 227 ]
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter". [ 228 ] By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. [ 229 ] [ 230 ] Upon ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865. [ 231 ]
As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists. [ 232 ]
Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen.
Lincoln biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current , according to David Lincove, argue that:
Eric Foner argues that:
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century. [ 235 ]
In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of republican values . As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism. [ 236 ] The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." [ 237 ] His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. [ 238 ] Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. [ 239 ] Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated. [ 240 ]
In March 1861, in Lincoln's first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people." [ 241 ]
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. [ 242 ] He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act , also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad , which was completed in 1869. [ 243 ] The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s. [ 244 ]
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff , the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861 , creating the first U.S. income tax. [ 246 ] This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($21,000 in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure. [ 247 ]
Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Act provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the Department of Agriculture . [ 248 ] In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the " Sioux Uprising " in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). [ 249 ] President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy. [ 250 ]
In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days. [ 251 ]
Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. [ 252 ] Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison 's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. [ 252 ] In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park . [ 253 ]
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." [ 252 ] Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne , nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller , nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field , a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party. [ 254 ]
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States , and 27 judges to the United States district courts . Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office.
West Virginia , admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. Nevada , which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864. [ 255 ]
John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. [ 256 ] In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) [ 257 ] to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners.
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. [ 258 ] Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre , Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State William H. Seward and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon , Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. At the last minute, Grant and his wife chose to travel to New Jersey to visit their children instead of attending the play. [ 259 ]
Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. [ 260 ] [ 261 ]
After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some 70 miles (110 km) south of Washington, D.C. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26. [ 262 ] [ 263 ]
An Army surgeon, Doctor Charles Leale , was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the President. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally. [ 264 ] The dying President was taken across the street to Petersen House . After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. Presbyterian minister Phineas Densmore Gurley , then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages." [ 265 ]
Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach " United States " and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting [ 266 ] bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing [ 267 ] [ 268 ] or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by.
As a young man, Lincoln was a religious skeptic , [ 269 ] or, in the words of a biographer, an iconoclast . [ 270 ] Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. [ 271 ] He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. [ 272 ] However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. [ 273 ] He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches. [ 274 ]
In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. [ 275 ] In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. [ 276 ] When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God. [ 277 ] The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. [ 278 ] After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." [ 279 ] On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land . [ 280 ]
Several claims abound that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder MEN2b , [ 281 ] which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma , mucosal neuromas and a Marfinoid appearance . Others simply claim he had Marfan's syndrome , based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible aortic regurgitation , which can cause bobbing of the head ( DeMusset's sign ) –  based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time. DNA analysis is so far being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia. [ 281 ]
In surveys of scholars ranking Presidents since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. [ 282 ] Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, Chicago Tribune 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, Time 2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed. [ 283 ]
President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. [ 284 ]
Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington. [ 285 ] In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes. [ 286 ]
By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives [ 287 ] for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. [ 288 ] [ 289 ] [ 290 ] As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the agrarian Democrats . [ 291 ] William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism". [ 292 ] James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform". Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders." [ 293 ]
By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian Lerone Bennett , were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues. [ 294 ] [ 295 ] Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. [ 296 ] He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; [ 297 ] and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. [ 298 ] The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. [ 299 ] [ 300 ] Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" in the late 20th century. [ 301 ] On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason". [ 302 ]
Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light. [ 303 ] [ 304 ]
Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency , the penny and the $5 bill . His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, [ 305 ] including the capital of Nebraska.
The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln's sculpture on Mount Rushmore ; [ 306 ] Ford's Theatre and Petersen House (where he died) in Washington and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum , located in Springfield, Illinois, not far from Lincoln's home and his tomb . [ 307 ] [ 308 ]
Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?" [ 309 ] However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness". [ 310 ] He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

Asia ( i / ˈ eɪ ʒ ə / or / ˈ eɪ ʃ ə / ) is the Earth's largest and most populous continent , located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres . It covers 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area and comprises 30% of its land area. With approximately 4.427 billion people, it hosts 60% of the world's current human population . Like most of the world, Asia has a high growth rate in the modern era. For instance, during the 20th century, Asia's population nearly quadrupled, as did the world population. [ 3 ]
The boundaries of Asia are culturally determined, as there is no clear geographical separation between it and Europe , which together form one continuous landmass called Eurasia . The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal , the Ural River , and the Ural Mountains , and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression ) and the Caspian and Black Seas . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean , on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean .
Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia – a name dating back to classical antiquity - may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography . [ 6 ] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.


The border between Asia and Europe has historically been determined by Europeans [ which? ] only. [ dubious – discuss ] The original distinction between the two was made by the ancient Greeks . They used the Aegean Sea , the Dardanelles , the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus , the Black Sea , the Kerch Strait , and the Sea of Azov as the border between Asia and Europe. The Nile was often used as the border between Asia and Africa (then called Libya), although some Greek geographers suggested the Red Sea would form a better boundary. [ 7 ] Darius ' canal between the Nile and the Red Sea introduced considerable variation in opinion. Under the Roman Empire , the Don River emptying into the Black Sea was the western border of Asia. It was the northernmost navigable point of the European shore. [ citation needed ] In the 15th century the Red Sea became established as the boundary between Africa and Asia, replacing the Nile. [ 7 ]
The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great , king of the Tsardom of Russia , defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia , synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 and assigned to Tobolsk , where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, Vasily Tatishchev , and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book. [ citation needed ]
In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects. [ 8 ] In the maps of the period, Transcaucasia was counted as Asian. The incorporation of most of that region into the Soviet Union tended to push views of the border to the south. Asian cultures had no say in this system of determining the imaginary boundaries separating them from Europe. [ citation needed ]
The border between Asia and the loosely defined region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Malay Archipelago . The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process." [ 7 ]
Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe. [ 9 ] It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents. [ 10 ]
From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them. [ 6 ] For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe , the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia". [ 11 ] Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass – or of Afro-Eurasia ; geologically, Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass (except for the Suez Canal) and share a common continental shelf . Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate , adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range ) on the North American Plate .
The English word, "Asia," was originally a concept of Greek civilization . [ 12 ] The place name, "Asia", in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience. Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain. It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names. A number of theories have been published. English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia. Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain.
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province Asia (Roman province) , which roughly corresponds with modern-day central-western Turkey. There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day Iraq . As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as Herodotus , who were all Greek. Roman civilization Hellenized extensively. Ancient Greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name. [ 13 ]
The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BC), not because he innovated it, but because his Histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully, [ 14 ] mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire , in contrast to Greece and Egypt . Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" ( Europa , Asia , and Libya , referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus (i.e. Hesione ), but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis . [ 15 ] In Greek mythology , "Asia" ( Ἀσία ) or "Asie" ( Ἀσίη ) was the name of a " Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia." [ 16 ]
Herodotus' geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement, as, having read the earlier Greek poetry along with everyone else literate, he would have known perfectly well why places received female names. Athens, Mycenae, Thebes and many other locations in fact had them. In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology."
For example, Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean , among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping." [ 17 ] Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains: [ 18 ]
"For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters."
The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer ) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia) in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning "Asian"); [ 19 ] and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος. [ 20 ]
Before Greek poetry, the Aegean Sea area was in a Greek Dark Age , at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire , the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.
The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BC by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B , deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, Michael Ventris , subsequently assisted by the scholar, John Chadwick . A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.
Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet, lawiaiai, "captives," associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia." [ 21 ] Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of Miletus , a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased. [ 22 ] The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia." This name, Assuwa , has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia". [ 23 ] The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BC.
Alternatively, the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word (w)aṣû(m) , which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word asa meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for Europe , as being from Akkadian erēbu(m) 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).
T.R. Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from asu , meaning 'east' in Assyrian ( ereb for Europe meaning 'west'). [ 12 ] The ideas of Occidental (form Latin Occidens 'setting') and Oriental (from Latin Oriens for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with Western and Eastern . [ 12 ] Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent. [ 12 ] Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject. [ 12 ]
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia , South Asia , Southeast Asia and the Middle East , linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes .
The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia , the Indus Valley and the Huanghe shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.
The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes . The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans , who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China , where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia , was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra . These areas remained very sparsely populated.
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.
The Islamic Caliphate took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, Song China reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people. [ 25 ]
The Black Death , one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road . [ 26 ]
The Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing Dynasty . In the 16th century, the Islamic Mughal Empire controlled much of India.
Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia . It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains , and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression ) and the Caspian and Black Seas . [ 5 ] [ 27 ] It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean , on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean . Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, two of them ( Russia and Turkey ) having part of their land in Europe.
Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.
A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of Bangladesh , India , Vietnam , Thailand , Pakistan and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate , the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003. A 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy . [ 28 ]
Asia has the second largest nominal GDP of all continents, after Europe, but the largest when measured in purchasing power parity . As of 2011, the largest economies in Asia are China , Japan , India , South Korea and Indonesia . [ 29 ] Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of top 5 were in Asia, Hong Kong , Singapore , Tokyo , Seoul and Shanghai . Around 68 percent of international firms have office in Hong Kong. [ 30 ]
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of the PRC [ 31 ] and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very high growth nations in Asia include Israel , Malaysia , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Thailand , Vietnam , Mongolia , Uzbekistan , Cyprus and the Philippines , and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , Iran , Brunei , United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and Oman .
According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective , India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history, [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] until the British Empire (excluding India ) overtook it in the mid-19th century. For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC ). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined. [ citation needed ] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen /US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim , known as the Asian tigers , which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita in Asia. [ 38 ]
It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2020. [ 39 ] By 2027, according to Goldman Sachs , China will have the largest economy in the world. Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the Association of Southeast Asian Nations .
Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in the China , Taiwan , South Korea , Japan , India, the Philippines , and Singapore . Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations , but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.
According to Citigroup 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh , China, India, Indonesia, Iraq , Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. [ 40 ] Asia has four main financial centers: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.
In 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe. [ 41 ] Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's "economic center of gravity" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia , China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.

With growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 international visitors. [ 43 ]
East Asia had by far the strongest overall Human Development Index (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report’s analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since 1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region’s top performers in improving school enrolment and life expectancy. [ 44 ] Nepal , a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world’s fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago. [ 44 ] Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the "very high human development" category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and Singapore (27). Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed. [ 44 ]
Asia is home to several language families and many language isolates . Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue , more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.
Many of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Christians in the Old Testament, is first found in Mesopotamian mythology , in the Epic of Gilgamesh . Hindu mythology tells about an Avatar of the God Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood. In ancient Chinese mythology , Shan Hai Jing , the Chinese ruler Da Yu , had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess Nüwa who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.
The Abrahamic religions of Judaism , Christianity , Islam and Bahá'í Faith originated in West Asia. Judaism , the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel , the birthplace and historical homeland of the Hebrew nation which today consists equally of those Israelites who remained in Asia/North Africa and those who returned from diaspora in Europe , North America , and other regions, [ 45 ] though sizable communities continue to live abroad.
Christianity is also present throughout Asia. In the Philippines and East Timor , Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese , respectively. In Armenia , Cyprus, Georgia and Asian Russia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion. Various Christian denominations have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India. Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. [ 46 ]
Islam , which originated in Saudi Arabia , is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia. With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia , followed by Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , Iran and Turkey . Mecca , Medina and to a lesser extent Jerusalem are the holiest cities for Islam in all the world. These religious sites attract large numbers of devotees from all over the world, particularly during the Hajj and Umrah seasons. Iran is the largest Shi'a country and Pakistan has the largest Ahmadiyya population.
The Bahá'í Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities. Lotus Temple is a big Baha'i Temple in India.
Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy . They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka , preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism , Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.
As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the second largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali , Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.
Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%), [ 48 ] Thailand (95%), [ 49 ] Burma (80%-89%), [ 50 ] Japan (36%–96%), [ 51 ] Bhutan (75%-84%), [ 52 ] Sri Lanka (70%), [ 53 ] Laos (60%-67%) [ 54 ] and Mongolia (53%-93%). [ 55 ] Large Buddhist populations also exist in Singapore (33%-51%), [ 56 ] Taiwan (35%–93%), [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] South Korea (23%-50%), [ 61 ] Malaysia (19%-21%), [ 62 ] Nepal (9%-11%), [ 63 ] Vietnam (10%–75%), [ 64 ] China (20%–50%), [ 65 ] North Korea (1.5%–14%), [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] and small communities in India and Bangladesh . In many Chinese communities, Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.
Jainism is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism for many Chinese, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.
Some of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the post- Second World War were:
The polymath Rabindranath Tagore , a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan , now in West Bengal , India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate . He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.
Other Asian writers who won Nobel Prize for literature include Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1968), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan, 1994), Gao Xingjian (China, 2000), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey, 2006), and Mo Yan (China, 2012). Some may consider the American writer, Pearl S. Buck , an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely The Good Earth (1931) and The Mother (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents of their time in China, The Exile and Fighting Angel , all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.
Also, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma(Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Most recently, Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China." He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.
Sir C. V. Raman is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him ".
Amartya Sen, (born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory , and for his interest in the problems of society's poorest members.
Other Asian Nobel Prize winners include Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar , Abdus Salam , Robert Aumann , Menachem Begin , Aaron Ciechanover , Avram Hershko , Daniel Kahneman , Shimon Peres , Yitzhak Rabin , Ada Yonath , Yasser Arafat , José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of Timor Leste , Kim Dae-jung , and 13 Japanese scientists. Most of the said awardees are from Japan and Israel except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Salam (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories) Kim (South Korea), Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).
In 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank , a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.
The Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career. [ 69 ] On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada. On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom. Most notable was the Nobel Peace Prize, presented in Oslo, Norway on 10 December 1989.

Europe ( i / ˈ jʊər ə p / or / ˈ j ɜr ə p / [ 2 ] ) is a continent that comprises the westernmost peninsula of Eurasia . It is generally divided from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways connecting the Black and Aegean Seas. [ 3 ]
Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Black Sea and connected waterways to the southeast. Yet the borders of Europe—a concept dating back to classical antiquity —are arbitrary, as the primarily physiographic term "continent" also incorporates cultural and political elements.
Europe is the world's second-smallest continent by surface area, covering about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi) or 2% of the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia is by far the largest by both area and population, taking up 40% of the continent (although the country has territory in both Europe and Asia), while Vatican City is the smallest. Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa , with a population of 739-743 million or about 11% of the world's population . [ 4 ] The most commonly used currency is the euro .
Europe, in particular ancient Greece , is the birthplace of Western culture . [ 5 ] It played a predominant role in global affairs from the 15th century onwards, especially after the beginning of colonialism . Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various times the Americas , most of Africa , Oceania , and the overwhelming majority of Asia . The Industrial Revolution , which began in Great Britain around the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Demographic growth meant that, by 1900, Europe's share of the world's population was 25%. [ 6 ]
Both world wars were largely focused upon Europe, greatly contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the United States and Soviet Union took prominence. [ 7 ] During the Cold War , Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east. European integration led to the formation of the Council of Europe and the European Union in Western Europe, both of which have been expanding eastward since the revolutions of 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The European Union nowadays has growing influence over its member countries. Many European countries are members of the Schengen Area , which abolishes border and immigration controls among its members.

The use of the term "Europe" has developed gradually throughout history. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In antiquity, the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the River Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don , rather than the Phasis , as the boundary between Europe and Asia. [ 12 ] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don. [ 13 ] The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar , separating it from North Africa , to the Don, separating it from Asia . [ 14 ]
A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam , and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianized western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy. [ 15 ] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance : "Europa" often figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin . [ 16 ] This division—as much cultural as geographical—was used until the Late Middle Ages , when it was challenged by the Age of Discovery . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ why? ] The problem of redefining Europe was finally resolved in 1730 when, instead of waterways, the Swedish geographer and cartographer von Strahlenberg proposed the Ural Mountains as the most significant eastern boundary, a suggestion that found favour in Russia and throughout Europe. [ 19 ]
Europe is now generally defined by geographers as the westernmost peninsula of Eurasia, with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River , and the Caspian Sea ; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains , the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. [ 20 ]
Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor) , but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and currently is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries. [ 21 ]
Sometimes, the word 'Europe' is used in a geopolitically limiting way [ 22 ] to refer only to the European Union or, even more exclusively, a culturally defined core. On the other hand, the Council of Europe has 47 member countries, and only 28 member states are in the EU. [ 23 ] In addition, people in the British Isles may refer to "continental" or "mainland" Europe as Europe. [ 24 ]
In ancient Greek mythology , Europa was a Phoenician princess whom Zeus abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull. He took her to the island of Crete where she gave birth to Minos , Rhadamanthus , and Sarpedon . For Homer , Europe ( Ancient Greek : Εὐρώπη , Eurṓpē ; see also List of Greek place names ) was a mythological queen of Crete, not a geographical designation.
The etymology of Europe is uncertain. [ 25 ] One theory suggests that it is derived from the Greek εὐρύς ( eurus ), meaning "wide, broad" [ 26 ] and ὤψ/ὠπ-/ὀπτ- ( ōps / ōp -/ opt- ), meaning "eye, face, countenance", [ 27 ] hence Eurṓpē , "wide-gazing", "broad of aspect" (compare with glauk ōp is (γλαυκῶπις 'grey-eyed') Athena or bo ōp is (βοὠπις 'ox-eyed') Hera ). Broad has been an epithet of Earth itself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion . [ 28 ] Another theory suggests that it is based on a Semitic word such as the Akkadian erebu meaning "to go down, set" [ 29 ] (in reference to the sun), cognate to Phoenician 'ereb "evening; west" and Arabic Maghreb , Hebrew ma'arav (see also Erebus , PIE *h 1 regʷos , "darkness"). However, Martin Litchfield West states that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor". [ 30 ]
Whatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure, Εὐρώπη is first used as a geographical term in the 6th century BC, by Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus . Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC. [ 31 ] But the convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius , [ 32 ] Strabo [ 33 ] and Ptolemy , [ 34 ] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary. The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church , as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world . The modern convention, enlarging the area of "Europe" somewhat to the east and the southeast, develops in the 19th century.
Most major world languages use words derived from "Europa" to refer to the "continent" (peninsula). Chinese, for example, uses the word Ōuzhōu (歐洲); a similar Chinese-derived term Ōshū ( 欧州 ? ) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, Ōshū Rengō ( 欧州連合 ? ) , despite the katakana Yōroppa ( ヨーロッパ ? ) being more commonly used. However, in some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan (land of the Franks ) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa . [ 35 ]
Homo erectus georgicus , which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in Georgia , is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe. [ 36 ] Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca , Spain . [ 37 ] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany ) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change , and their final refuge being present-day Portugal . The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans ( Cro-Magnons ), who appeared in Europe around 43 to 40 thousand years ago. [ 38 ]
The European Neolithic period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in Greece and the Balkans , probably influenced by earlier farming practices in Anatolia and the Near East . [ 39 ] It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine ( Linear Pottery culture ) and along the Mediterranean coast ( Cardial culture ). Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures , burial mounds and megalithic tombs . [ 40 ] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic . During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge , were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BC in Greece. [ 43 ]
The European Iron Age began around 1200 BC. [ 44 ] Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BC gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity.
Ancient Greece had a profound influence on Western civilisation. Western democratic and individualistic culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece. [ 45 ] The Greeks invented the polis , or city-state, which played a fundamental role in their concept of identity. [ 46 ] These Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy , humanism and rationalism under Aristotle , Socrates and Plato ; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides ; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer ; [ 45 ] in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen ; and in science with Pythagoras , Euclid and Archimedes . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
Another major influence came on Europe that would impact Western civilisation from the Roman Empire which left its mark on law , politics , language , engineering , architecture , government and many more aspects in western civilisation. [ 50 ] During the pax romana , the Roman Empire expanded to encompass the entire Mediterranean Basin and much of Europe. [ 51 ]
Stoicism influenced Roman emperors such as Hadrian , Antoninus Pius , and Marcus Aurelius , who all spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic , Pictish and Scottish tribes. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Christianity was eventually legitimised by Constantine I after three centuries of imperial persecution .
During the decline of the Roman Empire , Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the " Age of Migrations ". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths , Visigoths , Goths , Vandals , Huns , Franks , Angles , Saxons , Slavs , Avars , Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings , Pechenegs , Cumans and Magyars . [ 51 ] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages". [ 54 ] Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Europe. [ 55 ]
From the 7th century, Byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of Islam and the Caliphates . Muslim Arabs first invaded historically Roman territory under Abū Bakr , first Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate , who entered Roman Syria and Roman Mesopotamia . Under Umar , the second Caliph, the Muslims decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as Roman Palestine , Roman Egypt , and parts of Asia Minor and Roman North Africa . This trend continued under Umar's successors and under the Umayyad Caliphate , which conquered the rest of Mediterranean North Africa and most of the Iberian Peninsula . Over the next centuries Muslim forces were able to take further European territory, including Cyprus , Malta , Crete , Sicily and parts of southern Italy . [ 56 ] In the East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century. [ 57 ]
The Muslim conquest of Hispania began when the Moors (mostly Berbers with some Arabs ) invaded the Christian Visigothic kingdom of Iberia in the year 711, under their Berber leader Tariq ibn Ziyad . They landed at Gibraltar on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his superior, Musa ibn Nusair . During the eight-year campaign most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule — save for small areas in the northwest ( Asturias ) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees , with the exception of the Basque Banu Qasi Muslim dynasty. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus , became part of the expanding Umayyad empire.
The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. After their success in over-running Iberia, the conquerors moved northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, though they continued to raid and capture cities as far as Avignon . The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the ' Abbāsids and most of the Umayyad clan massacred.
A surviving Umayyad prince, Abd al-Rahman I , escaped to Iberia and founded a new Umayyad dynasty in the Emirate of Cordoba , (756). Charles Martel's son, Pippin the Short retook Narbonne , and his grandson Charlemagne established the Marca Hispanica across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia , reconquering Girona in 785 and Barcelona in 801. The Umayyads in Iberia proclaimed themselves caliphs in 929.
During the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively. [ 58 ] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis I . [ 59 ] Charlemagne , a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed " Holy Roman Emperor " by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire , which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe. [ 60 ]
East Central Europe saw the creation of Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). Powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkan Slavs. Moravia reached its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and caused a series of armed conflicts with East Francia . Further south, placed between the Frankish Empire and the Byzantines , the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century: First Bulgarian Empire , Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire ) and Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia ).
The predominantly Greek speaking Eastern Roman Empire retroactively became known in the West as the Byzantine Empire . Its capital was Constantinople . Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code , funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia and brought the Christian church under state control. [ 61 ] Fatally weakened by the sack of Constantinople in 1204 , during the Fourth Crusade , [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Byzantium fell in 1453 when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ]
The economic growth of Europe around the year 1000, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea . In this context, the growing independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.
The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe. [ 74 ] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament . [ 75 ] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church . Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe. [ 74 ]
The Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land . [ 76 ] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain , the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula . [ 77 ]
In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks , caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east. [ 78 ] Like many other parts of Eurasia , these territories were overrun by the Mongols . [ 79 ] The invaders, who became known as Tatars , were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans. [ 82 ]
The Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages. [ 83 ] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines, [ 86 ] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period. [ 87 ] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death , one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time. [ 88 ]
The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews , foreigners, beggars and lepers . [ 89 ] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century. [ 90 ] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe. [ 91 ]
The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in Florence and later spreading to the rest of Europe. in the 14th century. The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin . [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art , philosophy , music , and the sciences , under the joint patronage of royalty , the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church , and an emerging merchant class. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome , funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael , Michelangelo , and Leonardo da Vinci . [ 98 ] [ 99 ]
Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism . During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly. [ 100 ]
The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by the works of German theologian Martin Luther , a result of the lack of reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Empire's power, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths. [ 101 ] This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany , killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population. [ 102 ] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia , France rose to predominance within Europe. [ 103 ]
The 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline . [ 104 ] Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 to 1700. [ 105 ] From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves. [ 106 ] The Battle of Vienna in 1683 broke the advance of the Ottoman Turks into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe. The Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate had frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for at least a hundred years until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).
The Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development. [ 107 ] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus , Kepler , Galileo , and Isaac Newton . [ 108 ] According to Peter Barrett, "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world." [ 92 ] In the 15th century, Portugal and Spain , two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia. [ 111 ] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas , and Asia.
The Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution and the establishment of the First Republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror . [ 115 ] Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution and established the First French Empire that, during the Napoleonic Wars , grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo . [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the nation-state , as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of administration , law , and education . [ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] The Congress of Vienna , convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new balance of power in Europe centred on the five " Great Powers ": the UK , France , Prussia , Austria , and Russia. [ 121 ] This balance would remain in place until the Revolutions of 1848 , during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK . These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted. [ 122 ] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed ; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities. [ 123 ]
In parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) . As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution and Greek War of Independence marked the birth of nationalism in the Balkans . [ 124 ] Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro , Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.
The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment, and the rise of a new working class. [ 125 ] Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the first laws on child labour , the legalisation of trade unions , [ 126 ] and the abolition of slavery . [ 127 ] In Britain, the Public Health Act of 1875 was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities. [ 128 ] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900. [ 129 ] The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the Irish Potato Famine , caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people. [ 130 ] In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States . [ 131 ]
Two World Wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist [ 132 ] Gavrilo Princip . [ 133 ] Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers ( France , Belgium , Serbia , Portugal, Russia , the United Kingdom, and later Italy , Greece , Romania , and the United States) and the Central Powers ( Austria-Hungary , Germany , Bulgaria , and the Ottoman Empire ). The War left more than 16 million civilians and military dead. [ 134 ] Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918. [ 135 ]
Partly as a result of its defeat Russia was plunged into the Russian Revolution , which threw down the Tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist Soviet Union . [ 136 ] Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The Treaty of Versailles , which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions. [ 137 ]
Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine ) amounted to a combined total of 18 million. [ 138 ] In 1932–1933, under Stalin 's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths; [ 139 ] surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour . Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people; [ 140 ] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union. [ 141 ]
Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany , Francisco Franco of Spain and Benito Mussolini of Italy in power. [ 142 ] [ 143 ]
In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss . Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland , which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia , controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic . At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of appeasement .
With tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig , the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact , which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of World War II . [ 144 ] [ 145 ] The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.
In May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a bombing offensive on Britain , but failed to convince the Britons to give up. [ 146 ] In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the Operation Barbarossa . [ 147 ] On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire and other allied forces. [ 148 ] [ 149 ]
After the staggering Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The Battle of Kursk , which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front . In 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings , opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60 million dead across the world . [ 150 ] More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of World War II, [ 151 ] including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the Holocaust . [ 152 ] The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties. [ 153 ] By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40 million refugees . [ 154 ] Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people. [ 155 ]
World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an " Iron Curtain ". The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact . [ 156 ]
The two new superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation . At the same time decolonisation , which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa. [ 7 ] In the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more. [ 142 ]
European integration also grew after World War II. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market. [ 157 ] In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom formed the European Community , which in 1993 became the European Union . The EU established a parliament , court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency. [ 158 ] In 2004 and 2007, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.

Europe is a peninsula that makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass. [ 20 ] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent. [ 160 ] Its maritime borders are made up of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south [ 161 ] Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps , Pyrenees , and Carpathians , through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain , and at its heart lies the North German Plain . An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland , and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.
This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland , Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.
Europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones, being subjected to prevailing westerlies .
The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream . [ 162 ] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.
Therefore the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16 °C (60.8 °F), while it is only 12 °C (53.6 °F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (15 °F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk. [ 162 ]
The Geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary. [ 163 ]
Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and Alps / Carpathians . The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea , the North Sea , the Baltic Sea complex and Barents Sea .
The northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica , and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent Avalonia .
The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the Baltic Shield (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton , both around 2.25 billion years ago, followed by the Volgo-Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (≈ Baltica ) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia . Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia , later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading to the formation of Pangea . Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland , leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago. [ 164 ]
Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of Fennoscandia and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks .
The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed forest . The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ( Alps , Pyrenees ) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ( Scandinavian Mountains , Dinarides , Carpathians , Apennines ) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.
Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest. [ 165 ] It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation , Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the taiga of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%). [ 166 ]
In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak . In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce – pine – birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe ) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.
Glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of European fauna . As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the Neolithic period. Today wolves ( carnivores ) and bears ( omnivores ) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula , Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard , a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf , the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).
European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).
Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly, add to the biodiversity. [ 169 ]
The extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the Mediterranean . [ 170 ]
Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly phytoplankton . Important animals that live in European seas are zooplankton , molluscs , echinoderms , different crustaceans , squids and octopuses , fish, dolphins , and whales .
Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's Bern Convention , which has also been signed by the European Community as well as non-European states.
The list below includes all entities falling even partially under any of the various common definitions of Europe , geographic or political. The data displayed are per sources in cross-referenced articles.
Within the above-mentioned states are several de facto independent countries with limited to no international recognition . None of them are members of the UN:
Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found in Europe. Note that the list does not include the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, federal states of Germany and Austria, and autonomous territories of Spain and the post-Soviet republics as well as the republic of Serbia.
European integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of states wholly or partially in Europe. In the present day, European integration has primarily come about through the Council of Europe and European Union in Western and Central Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States in Central and Eastern Europe and most of former Soviet countries.
As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008. [ 175 ] In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak. [ 176 ] As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the West ; some of the Central and Eastern European economies are still emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia .
The European Union, an intergovernmental body composed of 28 European states, comprises the largest single economic area in the world. 18 EU countries share the euro as a common currency. Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in GDP (PPP) . This includes (ranks according to the CIA ): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10). [ 177 ]
There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is Moldova with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010). [ 178 ] Monaco is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism. [ 179 ] From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe. [ 180 ] The Industrial Revolution started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century, [ 181 ] and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin, [ 182 ] and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades. [ 183 ] Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s. [ 184 ] France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of Franco , also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the Spanish miracle . [ 185 ] The majority of Central and Eastern European states came under the control of the Soviet Union and thus were members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON). [ 186 ]
The states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the Marshall Plan . [ 187 ] The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the Cold War . Until 1990, the European Community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and Slovenia adopted them reasonably quickly, while Ukraine and Russia are still in the process of doing so.
After East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.
By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the Eurozone replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world. [ 188 ]
Figures released by Eurostat in January 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into recession in the third quarter of 2008. [ 189 ] It impacted much of the region. [ 190 ] In early 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis [ 191 ] developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. [ 192 ] As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone. [ 193 ]
The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in April 2012. [ 194 ] Recent university graduates have been unable to find work. [ 195 ] In April 2012, the unemployment rate in the EU27 for those aged 15–24 was 22.4%. [ 194 ]
Since the Renaissance , Europe has had a major influence in culture, economics and social movements in the world. The most significant inventions had their origins in the Western world, primarily Europe and the United States. [ 197 ] [ 198 ] Approximately 70 million Europeans died through war, violence and famine between 1914 and 1945. [ 199 ] Some current and past issues in European demographics have included religious emigration , race relations , economic immigration , a declining birth rate and an ageing population .
In some countries, such as Ireland and Poland, access to abortion is limited. It remains illegal on the island of Malta . Furthermore, three European countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland) and the Autonomous Community of Andalusia (Spain) [ 200 ] [ 201 ] have allowed a limited form of voluntary euthanasia for some terminally ill people.
In 2005, the population of Europe was estimated to be 731 million according to the United Nations, [ 202 ] which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the world's population . [ 203 ] The population of Europe has grown in the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular Africa and Asia) the population has grown far more quickly. [ 202 ] Among the continents, Europe has a relatively high population density , second only to Asia. The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is Monaco . Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities . [ 204 ] According to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653 million people (medium variant, 556 to 777 million in low and high variants, respectively). [ 202 ] Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates . The average number of children per female of child bearing age is 1.52. [ 205 ] According to some sources, [ 206 ] this rate is higher among Muslims in Europe . The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates. [ 207 ]
Europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at 70.6 million people, the IOM 's report said. [ 208 ] In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth . [ 209 ] The European Union plans to open the job centres for legal migrant workers from Africa. [ 210 ] [ 211 ] In 2008, 696,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU27 member state, a decrease from 707,000 the previous year. [ 212 ]
Emigration from Europe began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century, [ 213 ] [ 214 ] and French and English settlers in the 17th century. [ 215 ] But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe. [ 216 ]
Today, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in Uruguay , Argentina , Chile and Brazil , while most of the other Latin American countries also have a considerable population of European origins ). Australia and New Zealand have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of Cape Verde and probably São Tomé and Príncipe , depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the White South Africans . In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in Northern Asia (specifically Russians ), some parts of Northern Kazakhstan and Israel . [ 217 ] Additionally, transcontinental or geographically Asian countries such as Georgia , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Cyprus and Turkey have populations historically closely related to Europeans, with considerable genetic and cultural affinity.
European languages mostly fall within three Indo-European language groups: the Romance languages , derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire ; the Germanic languages , whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages . [ 164 ]
Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in Romania and Moldova , in Central or Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of Central Europe . [ 164 ]
Many other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European languages include the Baltic group (that is, Latvian and Lithuanian ), the Celtic group (that is, Irish , Scottish Gaelic , Manx , Welsh , Cornish , and Breton [ 164 ] ), Greek , Armenian , and Albanian . In addition, a distinct group of Uralic languages ( Estonian , Finnish , and Hungarian ) is spoken mainly in Estonia , Finland , and Hungary , while Kartvelian languages ( Georgian , Mingrelian , and Svan ), are spoken primarily in Georgia , and two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian , most notably including Chechen , Avar and Lezgin and Northwest Caucasian , notably including Adyghe ). Maltese is the only Semitic language that is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate . Turkic languages include Azerbaijani and Turkish , in addition to the languages of minority nations in Russia.
Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.
Historically , religion in Europe has been a major influence on European art , culture , philosophy and law . The largest religion in Europe is Christianity , with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christians , [ 218 ] including Catholic , Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Churches. Following these is Islam concentrated mainly in the Balkans and eastern Europe ( Bosnia and Herzegovina , Albania , Kosovo , Kazakhstan , North Cyprus , Turkey , Azerbaijan , North Caucasus , and the Volga-Ural region ). Other religions, including Judaism, Hinduism , and Buddhism are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of Kalmykia ). The 20th century saw the revival of Neopaganism through movements such as Wicca and Druidry .
Europe has become a relatively secular continent, with an increasing number and proportion of irreligious , atheist and agnostic people, actually the largest [ clarification needed ] in the Western world . There are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the Czech Republic, Estonia , Sweden, Germany (East), and France. [ 219 ]
The culture of Europe can be described as a series of overlapping cultures; cultural mixes exist across the continent. There are cultural innovations and movements, sometimes at odds with each other. Thus the question of "common culture" or "common values" is complex.
According to historian Hilaire Belloc , for several centuries the peoples of Europe based their self-identification on the remaining traces of the Roman culture and on the concept of Christendom , because many European-wide military alliances were of religious nature: the Crusades (1095–1291), the Reconquista (711-1492), the Battle of Lepanto (1571).

Google / ɡ uː ɡ (ə) l / is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search , cloud computing , and software . [ 8 ] Most of its profits are derived from AdWords . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University . Together they own about 14 percent of its shares but control 56 of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," [ 11 ] and its unofficial slogan was " Don't be evil ." [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In 2004, Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California , nicknamed the Googleplex . [ 14 ]
Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine . It offers online productivity software including email ( Gmail ), a cloud storage service ( Google Drive ), an office suite ( Google Docs ) and a social networking service ( Google+ ). Desktop products include applications for web browsing, organizing and editing photos , and instant messaging . The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS [ 15 ] for a netbook known as a Chromebook . Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers [ 16 ] in the production of its "high-quality low-cost" [ 17 ] Nexus devices and acquired Motorola Mobility in May 2012. [ 18 ] In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service. [ 19 ]
The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers on the world (as of 2007) [ 20 ] and to process over one billion search requests [ 21 ] and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day (as of 2009). [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] In December 2013 Alexa listed google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger . [ 26 ] Its market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including criticism of the company over issues such as search neutrality , copyright , censorship , and privacy . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]


Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California . [ 30 ]
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships between websites. [ 31 ] They called this new technology PageRank ; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
A small search engine called "RankDex" from IDD Information Services designed by Robin Li was, since 1996, already exploring a similar strategy for site-scoring and page ranking. [ 34 ] The technology in RankDex was patented in July 1999 [ 35 ] and used later when Li founded Baidu in China. [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Eventually, they changed the name to Google, originating from a misspelling of the word " googol ", [ 41 ] [ 42 ] the number one followed by one hundred zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information. [ 43 ] Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domains google.stanford.edu and z.stanford.edu . [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997, [ 46 ] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend ( Susan Wojcicki [ 30 ] ) in Menlo Park , California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee. [ 30 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]
In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from May 2010 (931 million). [ 49 ] In January 2013, Google announced it had earned US$50 billion in annual revenue for the year of 2012. This marked the first time the company had reached this feat, topping their 2011 total of $38 billion. [ 50 ]
The first funding for Google was an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim , co-founder of Sun Microsystems , given before Google was incorporated. [ 52 ] Early in 1999, while graduate students, Brin and Page decided that the search engine they had developed was taking up too much time and distracting their academic pursuits. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer and later criticized Vinod Khosla , one of Excite's venture capitalists, after he negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. On June 7, 1999, a $25 million round of funding was announced, [ 53 ] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital . [ 52 ]
Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024. [ 54 ] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse , underwriters for the deal. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] The sale of $1.67bn gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23bn. [ 59 ] By January 2014, its market capitalization had grown to $397bn. [ 60 ] The vast majority of the 271 million shares remained under the control of Google, and many Google employees became instant paper millionaires. Yahoo! , a competitor of Google, also benefited because it owned 8.4 million shares of Google before the IPO took place. [ 61 ]
There were concerns that Google's IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires. [ 62 ] As a reply to this concern, co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company's culture. [ 63 ] In 2005, articles in The New York Times and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on: a flat organization with a collaborative environment. [ 68 ] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees. [ 69 ] [ 70 ]
The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $700 for the first time on October 31, 2007, [ 71 ] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market. [ 72 ] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds . [ 72 ] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol GOOG and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1.
In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California , which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology startups. [ 73 ] The next year, against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine, [ 74 ] Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords. [ 30 ] In order to maintain an uncluttered page design and increase speed, advertisements were solely text-based. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bids and click-throughs, with bidding starting at five cents per click. [ 30 ]
This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered by Goto.com, an Idealab spin-off created by Bill Gross . [ 75 ] [ 76 ] When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamed Yahoo! Search Marketing . The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license. [ 77 ]
In 2001, Google received a patent for its PageRank mechanism. [ 78 ] The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California . [ 79 ] The complex became known as the Googleplex , a play on the word googolplex , the number one followed by a googol zeroes. The Googleplex interiors were designed by Clive Wilkinson Architects. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million. [ 80 ] By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb " google " to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary , denoted as "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet." [ 81 ] [ 82 ]
Google announced the launch of a new company called Calico on September 19, 2013, which will be led by Apple chairman Arthur Levinson . In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and wellbeing" company will focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases". [ 83 ]
As of September 2013, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries. [ 84 ] Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, although it has used other dates for its official birthday. [ 85 ] The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engine Yahoo! Search in 2005 has been suggested as the cause. [ 86 ] [ 87 ]
The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Google is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes Facebook , Intel and Microsoft . Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee , the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. [ 88 ]
The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 is reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements. [ 89 ]
In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new 1-million-sq-ft (93,000 sq m) office in London, which is due to open in 2016. The new premises will be able to accommodate 4,500 employees and has been identified as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions in Britain. [ 90 ]
In October 2014, according to the Interbrand ranking, Google was the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple ) with a valuation of $107.4 billion; [ 91 ] a Millward Brown report from the same year puts the Google brand ahead of Apple's at #1. [ 92 ]
Since 2001, Google has acquired many companies, primarily small venture capital-funded firms. In 2004, Google acquired Keyhole, Inc . [ 93 ] The start-up company developed a product called Earth Viewer that gave a three-dimensional view of the Earth. Google renamed the service to Google Earth in 2005. Google acquired Urchin Software in April 2005, using their 'Urchin on Demand' product (along with ideas from Adaptive Path's 'Measure Map') to create Google Analytics in 2006.
In October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock, and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006. [ 94 ] Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as " not material " in a regulatory filing. [ 95 ] In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 YouTube revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales. [ 96 ]
On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to acquire DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, giving Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies. [ 97 ] Later that same year, Google purchased GrandCentral for $50 million. [ 98 ] The site would later be changed over to Google Voice . On August 5, 2009, Google bought out its first public company, purchasing video software maker On2 Technologies for $106.5 million. [ 99 ] Google also acquired Aardvark , a social network search engine, for $50 million, and commented on its internal blog, "we're looking forward to collaborating to see where we can take it". [ 100 ] In April 2010, Google announced it had acquired a hardware startup, Agnilux. [ 101 ]
In addition to the many companies Google has purchased, the company has partnered with other organizations for research, advertising, and other activities. In 2005, Google partnered with NASA Ames Research Center to build 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m 2 ) of offices. [ 102 ] The offices would be used for research projects involving large-scale data management, nanotechnology , distributed computing , and the entrepreneurial space industry . Google entered into a partnership with Sun Microsystems in October 2005 to help share and distribute each other's technologies. [ 103 ]
The company also partnered with AOL [ 104 ] to enhance each other's video search services. Google's 2005 partnerships also included financing the new .mobi top-level domain for mobile devices, along with other companies including Microsoft , Nokia , and Ericsson . [ 105 ] Google would later launch " AdSense for Mobile ", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market. [ 106 ] Increasing its advertising reach even further, Google and Fox Interactive Media of News Corporation entered into a $900 million agreement to provide search and advertising on the then-popular social networking site MySpace . [ 107 ]
In 2007, Google began sponsoring NORAD Tracks Santa , displacing former sponsor AOL. NORAD Tracks Santa purports to follow Santa Claus' progress on Christmas Eve, [ 108 ] using Google Earth to "track Santa" in 3-D for the first time. [ 109 ] Google-owned YouTube gave NORAD Tracks Santa its own channel. [ 110 ]
In 2008, Google developed a partnership with GeoEye to launch a satellite providing Google with high-resolution (0.41 m monochrome, 1.65 m color) imagery for Google Earth. The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on September 6, 2008. [ 111 ] Google also announced in 2008 that it was hosting an archive of Life Magazine 's photographs. Some of the images in the archive were never published in the magazine. [ 112 ] The photos were watermarked and originally had copyright notices posted on all photos, regardless of public domain status. [ 113 ]
In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota . The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by NextEra Energy Resources , will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development. [ 114 ] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates. [ 115 ] The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates "own or control any generation or transmission" facilities. [ 116 ] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced that it will purchase all of the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm. [ 117 ]
Also in 2010, Google purchased Global IP Solutions , a Norway-based company that provides web-based teleconferencing and other related services. This acquisition enabled Google to add telephone-style services to its list of products. [ 118 ] On May 27, 2010, Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad network AdMob . This occurred days after the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation into the purchase. [ 119 ] Google acquired the company for an undisclosed amount. [ 120 ] In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years. [ 121 ]
On April 4, 2011, The Globe and Mail reported that Google bid $900 million for six thousand Nortel Networks patents. [ 122 ]
On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to-date when announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion [ 123 ] [ 124 ] subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola. [ 125 ] The merger was completed on the May 22, 2012, after the approval of People's Republic of China . [ 126 ]
This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies to help protect it in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies, [ 127 ] mainly Apple and Microsoft [ 125 ] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android . [ 128 ] After the acquisition closed, Google began to restructure the Motorola business to fit Google's strategy. On August 13, 2012, Google announced plans to layoff 4000 Motorola Mobility employees. [ 129 ] On December 10, 2012, Google sold the manufacturing operations of Motorola Mobility to Flextronics for $75 million. [ 130 ] As a part of the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture undisclosed Android and other mobile devices. [ 131 ] On December 19, 2012, Google sold the Motorola Home business division of Motorola Mobility to Arris Group for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction. As a part of this deal, Google acquired a 15.7% stake in Arris Group valued at $300 million. [ 132 ]
On June 5, 2012, Google announced it acquired Quickoffice , a company widely known for their mobile productivity suite for both iOS and Android. Google plans to integrate Quickoffice's technology into its own product suite. [ 133 ]
On February 6, 2013, Google announced it had acquired Channel Intelligence for $125 million. Channel Intelligence, a technology company that helps customers buy products online, is active globally in 31 different countries and works with over 850 retailers. Google will use this technology to enhance its e-commerce business. [ 134 ]
The official confirmation of Google's acquisition of the Israel-based startup Waze occurred in June 2013. Waze is promoted as a "community-based traffic and navigation app". [ 135 ]
Following the acquisition of Waze, Google submitted a "10-Q" filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) that revealed that the corporation spent $1.3 billion on acquisitions during the first half of 2013. The filing also revealed that the Waze acquisition cost Google $966 million, instead of the $1.1 billion figure that was initially presented in media sources. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ]
The 2012 acquisition of WIMM Labs, a company that previously made an Android-powered smartwatch , was confirmed in August 2013. As of August 31, 2013, Google has not publicly commented on the news concerning WIMM Labs. [ 138 ] The acquisition of Flutter, a creator of hand gesture recognition technology , was confirmed by the corporation in early October 2013. The reported price is $40 million and Google spokesperson stated: "We're really impressed by the Flutter team's ability to design new technology based on cutting-edge research." Flutter's technology allows users to enact hand gestures to control navigation for apps such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, and Winamp. [ 139 ]
On January 26, 2014 Google Inc. announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies , a privately held artificial intelligence company from London . DeepMind describes themselves as having the ability to combine the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build general-purpose learning algorithms. DeepMind's first commercial applications were used in simulations, e-commerce and games. As of December 2013, it was reported that DeepMind had roughly 75 employees. [ 140 ] The technology news website Re/code reported that the company was purchased for $400 million though it was not disclosed where the information came from. A Google spokesman would not comment of the price. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community. [ 143 ]
On January 29, 2014, Google announced it was selling its Motorola Mobility unit to China-based Lenovo , for $2.91bn. The company kept the extensive patent collection used to develop Android products, considered the most valuable part of the original deal. [ 143 ] Nonetheless the sale price was significantly less than the $12.5 billion Google had bought Motorola Mobility for. The $2.91bn price tag consisted of $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, and a $1.5 billion 3-year promissory note. [ 144 ]
In March 2014, Google confirmed it had purchased the remnants of gaming startup, Green Throttle Games, which developed a Bluetooth gaming controller for Android . [ 145 ]
In May 2014, Google announced it had purchased Quest Visual , maker of the augmented reality translator app Word Lens. [ 146 ]
In June 2014, Google purchased satellite imaging firm Skybox Imaging for $500 million. [ 147 ]
In July 2014, Google purchased the online music service Songza . [ 148 ]
As of 2014 [update] , Google Inc. owned and operated six Google Modular Data Centers across the U.S., one in Chile, one in Finland, one in Ireland, one in Belgium, one in Singapore and one on Taiwan. [ 149 ] In 2011, the company had announced plans to build three data centers at a cost of more than $200 million in Asia ( Singapore , Hong Kong and Taiwan ) and said they would be operational within two years. [ 150 ] [ 151 ]
In October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Google's data centers, as part of a program named MUSCULAR . [ 152 ] [ 153 ] This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not encrypt data passed inside its own network. [ 154 ] Google began encrypting data sent between data centers in 2013. [ 155 ]
For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues. [ 156 ] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs. [ 157 ] In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the company DoubleClick , to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history. [ 158 ] [ 159 ]
Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page. [ 160 ] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's AdWords allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google AdSense , allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked. [ 161 ]
One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud , which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid. [ 162 ]
In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of Oceana , a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations." [ 163 ] The policy was later changed. [ 164 ] In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of antitrust concerns by the U.S. Department of Justice . As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008. [ 165 ] [ 166 ]
In an attempt to advertise its own products, Google launched a website called Demo Slam, developed to demonstrate technology demos of Google Products . [ 167 ]
According to market research published by comScore in November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%. [ 168 ] Google indexes billions [ 169 ] of web pages, so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators .
In 2003, The New York Times complained about Google's indexing, claiming that Google's caching of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content. [ 170 ] In this case, the United States District Court of Nevada ruled in favor of Google in Field v. Google and Parker v. Google . [ 171 ] [ 172 ] The publication 2600: The Hacker Quarterly has compiled a list of words that the web giant's new instant search feature will not search. [ 173 ]
Google Watch has criticized Google's PageRank algorithms, saying that they discriminate against new websites and favor established sites. [ 174 ] The site has also alleged that there are connections between Google and the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). [ 175 ]
Google also hosts Google Books . The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books where allowed, into its new book search engine. The Authors Guild , a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books. [ 176 ] Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada. [ 177 ] Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ( Éditions du Seuil ) from its database. [ 178 ] In competition with Amazon.com , Google sells digital versions of new books. [ 179 ]
On July 21, 2010, in response to Bing , Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of thumbnails that enlarge when pointed at. Though web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches. [ 180 ]
The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box. [ 181 ]
Gmail , a free webmail service provided by Google, was launched as an invitation-only beta program on April 1, 2004, [ 182 ] and became available to the general public on February 7, 2007. [ 183 ] The service was upgraded from beta status on July 7, 2009, [ 184 ] at which time it had 146 million users monthly. [ 185 ] The service was the first online email service with one gigabyte of storage. It was also the first to keep emails from the same conversation together in one thread, similar to an Internet forum. [ 182 ] The service offers over 15 GB of free storage, shared with other Google Apps, with additional storage ranging from 20 GB to 16 TB available for $0.25 per 1 GB per year. [ 186 ]
Gmail uses AJAX , a programming technique that allows web pages to be interactive without refreshing the browser. [ 187 ] Steve Ballmer (Microsoft's former CEO), [ 188 ] Liz Figueroa , [ 189 ] Mark Rasch , [ 190 ] and the editors of Google Watch [ 191 ] have criticised the privacy of Gmail, but Google claims that mail sent to or from Gmail is never read by a human being beyond the account holder and is only used to improve relevance of advertisements. [ 192 ]
In 2004, Google started open source software project hosting, called Google Code , which allows developers to download incomplete programs at no charge. Google Docs , another part of Google's productivity suite, allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in an online environment, similar to Microsoft Word . The service was originally called Writely, but was obtained by Google on March 9, 2006, and was released as an invitation-only preview. [ 193 ] On June 6 after the acquisition, Google created an experimental spreadsheet editing program, [ 194 ] which was combined with Google Docs on October 10. [ 195 ]
Google Search Appliance was launched in February 2002, targeted toward providing search technology for larger organizations. [ 30 ] Google launched the Mini three years later, which was targeted at smaller organizations. Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008. [ 196 ]
Google Apps allows organizations to bring Google's web application offerings, such as Gmail and Google Docs , into their own domains. The service is available in several editions: a basic free edition (formerly known as Google Apps Standard edition), Google Apps for Business, Google Apps for Education, and Google Apps for Government. In the same year Google Apps was launched, Google acquired Postini [ 197 ] and proceeded to integrate the company's security technologies into Google Apps [ 198 ] under the name Google Postini Services. [ 199 ]
Google Translate is a server-side machine translation service, which can translate between 80 different languages. [ 200 ] For some languages, handwriting recognition , or speech recognition can be used as input, and translated text can be pronounced through speech synthesis . [ 201 ] The software uses corpus linguistics techniques, where the program "learns" from professionally translated documents, specifically UN and European Parliament proceedings. [ 202 ]
Google launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites. [ 203 ] In March 2005, Agence France Presse (AFP) sued Google for copyright infringement in federal court in the District of Columbia, a case which Google settled for an undisclosed amount in a pact that included a license of the full text of AFP articles for use on Google News. [ 204 ]
In 2006, Google made a bid to offer free wireless broadband access throughout the city of San Francisco along with Internet service provider EarthLink . Large telecommunications companies such as Comcast and Verizon opposed the efforts, claiming it was "unfair competition" and that cities would be violating their commitments to offer local monopolies to these companies. In his testimony before Congress on network neutrality in 2006, Google's Chief Internet Evangelist Vint Cerf blamed the tactics on the fact that nearly half of all consumers lack choice in broadband providers. [ 205 ] Google currently offers free wi-fi access in its hometown of Mountain View, California. [ 206 ]
In 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project with plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities. [ 207 ] On March 30, 2011, Google announced that Kansas City, Kansas would be the first community where the new network would be deployed. [ 208 ] In July 2012, Google completed the construction of a fiber-optic broadband internet network infrastructure in Kansas City, and after building an infrastructure, Google announced pricing for Google Fiber. The service will offer three options including a free broadband internet option, a 1Gbit/s internet option for $70 per month, and a version that includes television service for $120 per month. [ 19 ]
In 2007, reports surfaced that Google was planning the release of its own mobile phone, possibly a competitor to Apple 's iPhone . [ 209 ] [ 210 ] [ 211 ] The project, called Android , turned out not to be a phone but an operating system for mobile devices, which Google acquired and then released as an open source project under the Apache 2.0 license . [ 212 ] Google provides a software development kit for developers so applications can be created to be run on Android-based phones. In September 2008, T-Mobile released the G1 , the first Android-based phone. [ 213 ] On January 5, 2010, Google released an Android phone under its own company name called the Nexus One . [ 214 ] A report in July 2013 stated that Google's share of the global smartphone market, led by Samsung products, was 64% in March 2013. [ 215 ]
Other projects Google has worked on include a new collaborative communication service, a web browser, and a mobile operating system. The first of these was first announced on May 27, 2009. The company described Google Wave as a product that helps users communicate and collaborate on the web. The service is Google's "email redesigned", with realtime editing, the ability to embed audio, video, and other media, and extensions that further enhance the communication experience. Google Wave was initially in a developer's preview, where interested users had to be invited to test the service, but was released to the general public on May 19, 2010, at Google's I/O keynote. On September 1, 2008, Google pre-announced the upcoming availability of Google Chrome , an open source web browser , [ 216 ] which was then released on September 2, 2008. On July 7, 2009, Google announced Google Chrome OS , an open source Linux-based operating system that includes only a web browser and is designed to log users into their Google account. [ 217 ] [ 218 ]
Google Goggles is a mobile application available on Android and iOS used for image recognition and non-text-based search. In addition to scanning QR codes , the app can recognize historic landmarks, import business cards, and solve Sudoku puzzles. [ 219 ] While Goggles could originally identify people as well, Google has limited that functionality as a privacy protection. [ 220 ]
In 2011, Google announced Google Wallet , a mobile application for wireless payments. [ 221 ] In late June 2011, Google soft-launched a social networking service called Google+ .
